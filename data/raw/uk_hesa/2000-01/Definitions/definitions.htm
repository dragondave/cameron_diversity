<h2><i>Staff Data </i></h2>
<p>
<h3>Coverage</h3>
<p>
The Staff Individualised Record provides data in respect of the characteristics of members of academic staff employed under a contract of employment by a HEI in the UK. Academic staff are defined as those whose primary employment function is teaching only, teaching & research or research only. Staff data relate to individual academic appointments (of at least 25% of a full-time equivalent member of staff) active during the academic year, 1 August 2000 to 31 July 2001. The HESA staff population excludes those members of staff who left their employment (but not necessarily the institution) before 1 August 2000.  
<p>
<h3>Rounding Strategy</h3>
<p>
Due to the provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Human Rights Act 1998, HESA now implements a strategy in published and released tabulations designed to prevent the disclosure of personal information about any individual. These tabulations are derived from the HESA non-statutory populations and may differ slightly from those published by related statutory bodies. This strategy involves rounding all numbers to the nearest 5. A summary of this strategy is as follows:
<p>
	<ol>
	<li> 0, 1, 2 are rounded to 0
	<li> All other numbers are rounded to the nearest 5
	</ol>
<p>
So for example 3 is represented as 5, 22 is represented as 20, 3286 is represented as 3285 while 0, 20, 55, 3510 remain unchanged.
<p>
Total figures are also subject to this rounding methodology; the consequence of which is that the sum of numbers in each row or column will rarely match the total shown precisely.
<p>
Average values, proportions and FTE values prepared by HESA are not subject to the above strategy, and will be calculated on precise raw numbers. However, percentages calculated on populations which contain less than 50 individuals will be suppressed and represented as ‘..’ as will averages based on populations of 7 or less.
<p>
Data on financial affairs of higher education institutions does not fall within the definition of ‘personal data’ under the Data Protection Act 1998, and is therefore exempt from the above provisions.
<p>
<h3>Mode of Employment</h3>
<p>
<B>Full-time staff </b>are those whose contracts state that their mode of employment is full-time. This includes staff who work full-time for part of a year and term-time only staff who work full-time during the term.
<p>
<B>Part-time staff</b> are those staff that work anything less than full-time. This category includes casual staff, those paid hourly and any staff whose mode of employment could not be assigned as full-time. 
<p>
<h3>Principal Source of Salary</h3>
<p>
<b>Wholly institutionally financed</b> staff are those who are paid wholly from general institution funds.
<p>
<b>All other sources of finance</b> staff are paid mainly or partly from sources other than general institutional funds.  These other sources include OST research councils, UK based charities, UK government bodies, local authorities, health & hospital authorities, UK industry commerce & public corporations, EU sources, other overseas sources and other sources not listed. 
<p>
<h3>Clinical Status</h3>
<p>
<b>Clinical</b> staff are those paid on clinical rates, e.g. doctors, dentists.  These staff may or may not hold honorary contracts with the NHS.
<p>
<b>Non-clinical</b> staff are those not paid on clinical rates.  These staff may or may not be medically qualified. 
<p>
<h3>Primary Employment Function</h3>
<p>
The primary employment function of a member of staff relates to the contract of employment and not the actual work undertaken.  
<p>
<b>Teaching only</b> staff are those whose contracts of employment state that they are employed only to undertake teaching.
  <p>
<b>Teaching & research</b> staff are those whose contracts of employment state that they are employed to undertake both teaching and research. 
<p>
<b>Research only</b> staff are those whose contracts of employment state that they are employed only to undertake research. 
<p>
Where ‘Teaching/Teaching & Research’ appears with ‘Research only’, the ‘Teaching only’ and ‘Teaching & Research’ categories have been aggregated. 
<p>
<h3>Grade</h3>
<p>
The grade structure indicates a staff member’s grade for their present employment. Groups of grades have been devised with regard to the different grading scales used within different institutions. Grades have not, however, been linked to salary information. 
<p>
<b>Professors </b>includes heads of departments, professors, former UAP scale researchers (grade IV), clinical professors and those appointed professors on a locally determined scale. 
<p>
<B>Senior lecturers & researchers</b> includes principal lecturers, senior lecturers (former UAP/CSCFC scales), former UAP scale researchers (grade III), clinical senior lecturers and those appointed senior or principal lecturers on a locally determined scale. 
<p>
<b>Lecturers</b> includes lecturers, senior lecturers (former PCEF scale), clinical lecturers and those appointed lecturers on a locally determined scale. 
<p>
<b>Researchers</b> includes all research grades not listed above and those researchers appointed on a locally determined scale. 
<p>
<b>Other grades</b> includes other grades of academic staff not listed above. 
<p>
Analysis by ‘staff grade’ is only meaningful where institutions have reported their staff within nationally recognised grade structures or within internal grade structures, which facilitate differentiation on a similar basis. Several institutions, including some large post-1992 universities, report their staff on a single grade structure, which does not have an independent category for the professor grade. Hence staff on the professor grade at institutions using the single grade scale cannot be distinguished from the senior lecturer grade, leading to the number of professors being under-counted for these institutions and for the sector as a whole. This under-counting will have a consequential effect on the proportions of professors within particular subject areas, cost centres and by gender. The Agency therefore advises caution in analysis of staff by grade.
<p>
<h3>Location of Institution</h3>
<p>
The allocation of an institution to a geographical region relates only to the administrative centre of that institution. 
<p>
There may be staff employed at institutions who are working in regions other than that of the administrative centre of the institution.  
<p>
The Open University is counted as a wholly English institution. Their administrative centre is located in England, although The Open University teaches throughout the UK. 
<p>
<h3>Academic Departmental Groups and Cost Centres</h3>
<p>
Primary cost centres have been assigned to groups of academic departments which reflect both academic similarities and comparable resource requirements.

<P>
Age of academic staff is as at 31 August 2000. Average age was calculated on actual age (as opposed to age groups) for staff with known age.
<P>
<h3>Movement of Staff</h3>
<P>
<b>Inflow</b> - information on employment in the previous year is used to identify staff who are new to higher education service, i.e. staff whose employment in the previous year is not the current institution or another higher education institution are deemed to be new to higher education service. 
<P>
<b>Outflow</b> - information on the destination on leaving is used to identify staff who have left higher education service, i.e. staff whose destination on leaving is not the current institution or another higher education institution are deemed to have left higher education service. 
<P>
<B>Employment in the previous year</b> and <b>destination</b> include all staff currently working in a UK HEI regardless of whether they are new to higher education service, remaining in higher education or are leaving higher education service. 
<P>
<h3>Ethnicity</h3>
<P>
The categories are those used in the 1991 Census of Population (Source: Office of Population Censuses and Surveys).  It is open to staff members not to reveal their ethnicity. HESA therefore advises that any figures produced are derived from a subset which may not be representative of the total academic staff population. 
<P>
<h3>Disability</h3>
<P>
Disability categories indicate the type of disability that a member of staff has on the basis of their own self-assessment and are consistent with those used in respect of HE students. Staff are not obliged to report a disability and as a result some institutions have not returned disability data for some of their staff. HESA therefore advises that the figures reported in analyses are derived from a subset, which may not be representative of the total staff population.

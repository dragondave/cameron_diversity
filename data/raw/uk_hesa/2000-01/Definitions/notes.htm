Use of the new cost centres was compulsory for institutions in England and Northern Ireland in 1998/99. In addition, cost centre 15 (General sciences) and cost centre 22 (Other technologies) were not used by institutions in England and Northern Ireland from 1998/99.<br><br>

9. For the 1999/2000 year HESA issued extra guidance to institutions in relation to the grade field, which resulted in some institutions changing their reporting practice. This guidance was also issued for 2000/01, and although it appears that there has been no significant effect on reporting practices in this year, care should be taken when undertaking time series analysis by grade.<br><br>

10. Average age was calculated on actual age (as opposed to age groups) for staff with known age.<br><br>

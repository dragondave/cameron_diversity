Use of the new cost centres was compulsory for institutions in England and Northern Ireland in 1998/99.

			For the 1999/2000 year HESA issued extra guidance to institutions in relation to the grade field, which resulted in some institutions changing their reporting practice. This guidance was also issued for 2000/01 and 2001/02, and although it appears that there has been no significant effect on reporting practices in these years, care should be taken when undertaking time series analysis by grade. </td></tr>

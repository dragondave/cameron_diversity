This includes all expenditure incurred (whether centrally or departmentally) on the maintenance of premises (including academic buildings, central academic services, art centres, institution’s health service premises, pavilions, sports buildings, etc) and on roads and grounds except residences and catering. Staff concerned with building maintenance, including estates administrative staff, are included in this category. 

		</p><h4>

Residences and catering operations

		</h4><p>

This includes the gross expenditure incurred in providing the residence, catering and any conference operations, including the cost of maintenance of residential and catering premises, salaries and any other identifiable costs relating to these operations. The depreciation costs and financing costs of these operations are included in appropriate categories of expenditure.

		</p><h4>

Research grants and contracts

		</h4><p>

This includes the total of the direct costs attributed to research grants and contracts as detailed for research grants and contracts income.

		</p><h4>

Other expenditure

		</h4><p>

This includes the total direct costs attributed to other services rendered, and all other expenditure not covered above.

		</p><h4>

Location of institution
	
		</h4><p>

The allocation of an institution to a geographical region relates only to the administrative centre of that institution. There may be staff employed at institutions who are working in regions other than that of the administrative centre of the institution.  

		</p><p>

The Open University is counted as a wholly English institution. Their administrative centre is located in England, although the Open University teaches throughout the UK. In certain analysis the Open University may therefore be shown separately.

Staff data

		</i></h2><h3>

Rounding strategy

		</h3><p>

Due to the provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Human Rights Act 1998, HESA implements a strategy in published and released tabulations designed to prevent the disclosure of personal information about any individual. These tabulations are derived from the HESA non-statutory populations and may differ slightly from those published by related statutory bodies. This strategy involves rounding all numbers to the nearest 5. A summary of this strategy is as follows:

		</p><p>

0, 1, 2 are rounded to 0			<Br>
All other numbers are rounded to the nearest 5

		</p><p>

So for example 3 is represented as 5, 22 is represented as 20, 3286 is represented as 3285 while 0, 20, 55, 3510 remain unchanged.

		</p><p>

This rounding strategy is also applied to total figures; the consequence of which is that the sum of numbers in each row or column will rarely match the total shown precisely.

		</p><p>

Average values, proportions and FTE values prepared by HESA will not usually be affected by the above strategy, and will be calculated on precise raw numbers. However, tabulations derived from the New Aggregate Staff Record (Tables 17 and 18) will be rounded.  Percentages calculated on populations which contain less than 50 individuals will be suppressed and represented as '..' as will averages based on populations of 7 or less.

		</p><p>

Data on financial affairs of higher education institutions does not fall within the definition of ‘personal data’ under the Data Protection Act 1998, and is therefore exempt from the above provisions.

		</p><h2><i>

Individualised staff data 

		</i></h2><h3>

Coverage

		</h3><p>

Data from the Staff Individualised Record is used to populate tables 4 to 16 (inclusive). The Staff Individualised Record provides data in respect of the characteristics of members of academic staff employed under a contract of employment by a HEI in the UK. <b>Academic staff </b>are defined as those whose primary employment function is teaching only, teaching & research or research only. Staff data relate to individual academic appointments (of at least 25% of a full-time equivalent member of staff) active during the academic year, 1 August 2002 to 31 July 2003. The HESA staff population excludes those members of staff who left their employment (but not necessarily the institution) before 1 August 2002.


		</p><h3>

Mode of employment

		</h3><p><b>

Full-time staff 		</b>
are those whose contracts state that their mode of employment is full-time. This includes staff who work full-time for part of a year and term-time only staff who work full-time during the term.

		</p><p><b>

Part-time staff 		</b>
are those staff that work anything less than full-time. This category includes casual staff, those paid hourly and any staff whose mode of employment could not be assigned as full-time.

		</p><h3> 
 
Principal source of salary

		</h3><p><b>

Wholly institutionally financed staff 		</b>
are those who are paid wholly from general institution funds.

		</p><p>

Staff 		<b>
Principally financed by the institution 		</b>
are paid mainly from general institution funds and partly from another source.

		</p><p><b>

All other sources of finance staff 		</b>
are paid wholly or partly from sources other than general institutional funds.  These other sources include OST research councils, UK based charities, UK government bodies, local authorities, health & hospital authorities, UK industry commerce & public corporations, EU sources, other overseas sources and other sources not listed.

		</p><p>

Where 		<b>
All other sources of finance 		</b>
appears in conjunction with 		<b>
Wholly institutionally financed 		</b>
it should be taken to mean ‘Principally financed by the institution’ plus ‘Other sources of finance’.

		</p><h3>

Clinical status

		</h3><p><B>

Clinical staff 		</b>
are those paid on clinical rates, e.g. doctors and dentists. These staff may or may not hold honorary contracts with the NHS.

		</p><p><b>

Non-clinical staff 		</b>
are those not paid on clinical rates and may or may not be medically qualified.

		</p><h3>

Primary employment function

		</h3><p>

The primary employment function of a member of staff relates to the contract of employment and not the actual work undertaken.  

		</p><p><b>

Teaching only 		</b>
staff are those whose contracts of employment state that they are employed only to undertake teaching.
  
		</p><p><b>

Teaching & research 		</b>
staff are those whose contracts of employment state that they are employed to undertake both teaching and research. 

		</p><p><b>

Research only 		</b>
staff are those whose contracts of employment state that they are employed only to undertake research. 

		</p><p>

Where 		<b>
‘Teaching/teaching & research’ 		</b>
appears with ‘Research only’, the ‘Teaching only’ and ‘Teaching & research’ categories have been aggregated. 

		</p><h3>

Grade

		</h3><p>

The grade structure indicates a staff member’s grade for their present employment. Groups of grades have been devised with regard to the different grading scales used within different institutions. Grades have not, however, been linked to salary information. 

		</p><p><b>

Professors 		</b>
includes heads of departments, professors, former UAP scale researchers (grade IV), clinical professors and those appointed professors on a locally determined scale. 

		</p><p><b>

Senior lecturers & researchers 		</b>
includes principal lecturers, senior lecturers (former UAP/CSCFC scales), former UAP scale researchers (grade III), clinical senior lecturers and those appointed senior or principal lecturers on a locally determined scale. 

		</p><p><b>

Lecturers 		</b>
includes lecturers, senior lecturers (former PCEF scale), clinical lecturers and those appointed lecturers on a locally determined scale. 

		</p><p><b>

Researchers 		</b>
includes all research grades not listed above and those researchers appointed on a locally determined scale. 

		</p><p><b>

Other grades 		</b>
includes other grades of academic staff not listed above. 

		</p><p>

Analysis by staff grade is meaningful only where institutions have reported their staff within nationally recognised grade structures, or within internal grade structures that facilitate discrimination on a similar basis. Several institutions, including some large post-1992 universities, report their staff on a single grade structure lacking a separate category for the ‘Professor’ grade. Where this happens, Professors cannot be distinguished from staff on the Senior Lecturer (pre-1992) or Principal Lecturer (post-1992) grade, leading to Professors being zero-counted for those institutions and under-counted for the sector as a whole. This under-counting limits the scope of comparative analyses of the proportion of Professors within particular subject areas, by cost centres, by gender, and so on.

		</p><h3>

Academic departmental groups and cost centres

		</h3><p>

Primary cost centres have been assigned to groups of academic departments which reflect both academic similarities and comparable resource requirements.

Age of academic staff is as at 31 August 2002. Average age was calculated on actual age (as opposed to age groups) for staff with known age.

		</p><h3>

Movement of staff

		</h3><p><b>

Inflow 		</b>
- information on employment in the previous year is used to identify staff who are new to the UK higher education service, i.e. staff whose employment in the previous year is not the current institution or another UK higher education institution are deemed to be new to higher education service. 

		</p><p><b>

Outflow 		</b>
- information on the destination on leaving is used to identify staff who have left higher education service, i.e. staff whose destination on leaving is not the current institution or another UK higher education institution are deemed to have left higher education service. 

		</p><p><b>

Employment in the previous year 		</b>
and 					<b>
destination 				</b>
include all staff currently working in a UK HEI regardless of whether they are new to higher education service, remaining in higher education or are leaving higher education service.

Ethnicity

		</h3><p>

It is HESA’s intention to adopt national classifications where they exist and are appropriate. However, in this instance, there is no coding structure for ethnicity that is applicable throughout the UK, as variations to the Census 2001 ethnicity coding were adopted in both Scotland and Northern Ireland. To accommodate requirements for institutions in these regions to report locally to their devolved administrations, the coding frame has been revised.

		</p><p>

Staff may choose not to reveal their ethnicity and therefore HESA advises that the figures reported in analyses are derived from a subset, which may not be representative of the total staff population.

		</p><p>

The following entries have been grouped together and this may mean that the ethnicity groupings used in previous years may not now be comparable:

		</p><p>

The ethnic category ‘White’ includes the entries: 		<br>
White 		<br>
White - British		<br>
White - Irish		<br>
White - Scottish		<br>
Irish traveller		<br>
Other white background

		</p><p>

The ethnic category ‘Other (including mixed)’ includes the entries:		<br>
Mixed - White and Black Caribbean		<br>
Mixed - White and Black African		<br>
Mixed - White and Asian		<br>
Other mixed background		<br>
Other ethnic background

		</p><h3>

Disability

		</h3><p>

Disability categories indicate the type of disability that a member of staff has on the basis of their own self-assessment and are consistent with those used in respect of HE students. Staff are not obliged to report a disability and as a result some institutions have not returned disability data for some of their staff. HESA therefore advises that the figures reported in analyses are derived from a subset, which may not be representative of the total staff population.

		</p><h2><i>

New aggregate staff data

		</i></h2><h3>

Coverage

		</h3><p>

Data from the New Aggregate Staff Record is used to populate tables 17 and 18. The New Aggregate Staff Record provides data in respect of the characteristics of members of all academic and non-academic staff who have a contract of employment with the institution on 1 April 2003. Staff employed under consultancy contracts, or on the basis of payment of fees for services, without a contract of employment, are not included in the record.

		</p><h3>

Grade

		</h3><p>

The academic grade structure indicates a staff member’s grade for their present employment. Groups of grades have been devised with regard to the different grading scales used within different institutions. Grades have not, however, been linked to salary information. 

		</p><p><b>

Senior academics & professors 		</b>
includes deans, heads of department, vice-chancellors, professors, former UAP scale researchers (grade IV), clinical professors and those appointed professors on a locally determined scale.

		</p><p><b>

Senior lecturers & researchers 		</b>
includes principal lecturers, senior lecturers (former UAP/CSCFC scales), former UAP scale researchers (grade III), clinical senior lecturers and those appointed senior or principal lecturers on a locally determined scale. 

		</p><p><b>

Lecturers 		</b>
includes lecturers, senior lecturers (former PCEF scale), clinical lecturers and those appointed lecturers on a locally determined scale. 

		</p><p><b>

Researchers 		</b>
includes all research grades not listed above and those researchers appointed on a locally determined scale. 

		</p><p><b>

Other grades 		</b>
includes other grades of academic staff not listed above. 

		</p><p>

Visiting lecturers are advised to return their academic grade as either ‘Senior Lecturers and Researchers’ or  ‘Lecturers’, unless the grade is not known, in which case to return it as ‘Other Grades’. 

		</p><p>

Analysis by staff grade is meaningful only where institutions have reported their staff within nationally recognised grade structures, or within internal grade structures that facilitate discrimination on a similar basis. Several institutions, including some large post-1992 universities, report their staff on a single grade structure lacking a separate category for the ‘Professor’ grade. Where this happens, Professors cannot be distinguished from staff on the Senior Lecturer (pre-1992) or Principal Lecturer (post-1992) grade, leading to Professors being zero-counted for those institutions and under-counted for the sector as a whole. This under-counting limits the scope of comparative analyses of the proportion of Professors within particular subject areas, by cost centres, by gender, and so on.

SOC – Occupational coding for higher education staff

		</h3><p>

The Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) provides a national standard for categorising occupational information. SOC forms the basis of occupational classification in a variety of national surveys that collect statistical information such as the Labour Force Survey and New Earnings Survey. The utilisation of SOC for classifying occupations within the Higher Education (HE) sector therefore both allows for the heterogeneity of occupations that exist and enables comparisons to be made with other sectors of the economy and from a variety of data sources.

		</p><p>

However, some difficulties emerge in the direct application of SOC for occupational coding within the HE sector. At the most aggregate level, SOC distinguishes nine broad categories termed Major Groups. The titles associated with these Major Groups, which by necessity have to be general in their nature to encompass all occupations, do not provide an intuitive method of classifying the occupations within HE. Additionally, the coding manuals of the Standard Occupational Classification contain information on many occupations and job titles that are not relevant to the HE sector. 

		</p><p>

The classification of occupations within higher education has therefore necessitated the development of a variant of the national standard that is relevant for the HE sector. This enables the classification of job titles found within the HE sector to fall into one of 13 broad occupational categories:

		</p><p>

Managers											<br>
Academic professionals										<br>
Non-academic professionals										<br>
Laboratory, engineering, building, it and medical technicians (including nurses)					<br>
Student welfare workers; careers advisers; vocational training instructors; personnel and planning officers		<br>
Artistic, media, public relations, marketing and sports instruction occupations					<br>
Library assistants, clerks and general administrative assistants						<br>
Secretaries, typists, receptionists and telephonists								<br>
Chefs, gardeners, electrical and construction trades, mechanical fitters and printers				<br>
Caretakers, residential wardens, sports and leisure attendants, nursery nurses and care occupations			<br>
Retail and customer service occupations									<br>
Drivers, maintenance supervisors and plant operatives							<br>
Cleaners, catering assistants, security officers, porters and maintenance workers

		</p><p><b>

Academic staff 		</b>
are defined as academic professionals who are responsible for planning, directing and undertaking academic teaching and research within HE institutions. They also include medical practitioners, dentists, veterinarians and other health care professionals who undertake lecturing or research activities. All academic staff fall into group 2A of the SOC classification, regardless of their discipline (e.g. science, engineering, social sciences, humanities, languages).

		</p><p><b>

Non-academic 		</b>
staff are defined as members of staff who fall into one of the remaining 12 occupational categories such as managers, non-academic professionals, student welfare workers, secretaries, caretakers and cleaners.

		</p><p>

Further details have been outlined in the report ‘Occupational coding for higher education staff’, written and devised by the Institute for Employment Research, University of Warwick.

		</p><h3>
 
Full-time equivalent (FTE)

		</h3><p>

Full-time equivalent (FTE) is that recorded in the contract and is a measure of the intensity of employment during the contract period. For example, the FTE of part-time staff working half time would be 050.0 and the FTE of any full-time staff would be 100.0, regardless of the length of the contract.

		</p><h3>

Staff with multiple contracts

		</h3><p>

For those members of staff who held multiple contracts on 1 April 2003, it has been advised that where FTE information has been provided, the multiple contracts are added together to give a measure of the ‘intensity’ of their employment. The exception to this guidance is where the member of staff holds contracts at different grades, or where an academic post is held in addition to a non-academic one. In this case FTE for each contract is counted separately. The FTE for staff who hold a full-time contract as well as a part-time one is the total for both the full-time and part-time contracts added together.

Where comparisons are made between the latest financial year 2002/03 and the previous year 2001/02, the previous year’s figures are those reported in the re-stated financial statements.

		<br><br></li><li>

The surplus/deficit is on continuing operations after depreciation of fixed assets at valuation and before exceptional items, tax and minority interest.

		<br><br></li><li>

The funding council grants for HE provision include SHEFC grants for all provision. 

		<br><br></li><li>

The funding council grants for FE provision are not applicable to SHEFC. 

		<br><br></li><li>

As a consequence of a review of cost centres by funding councils, additional cost centres were introduced in 1997/98. Use of the new cost centres was compulsory for institutions in England and Northern Ireland in 1998/99. In addition, cost centre 15 (General sciences) and cost centre 22 (Other technologies) were not used by institutions in England and Northern Ireland from 1998/99.

		<br><br></li><li>

As a result of departmental restructuring in 2002/03, following the merger of London Guildhall University and the University of North London to form London Metropolitan University, the allocation of data between HESA Cost Centres cannot be relied upon as accurate.

		<br><br></li><li>

For the 1999/2000 year HESA issued extra guidance to institutions in relation to the grade field which resulted in some institutions changing their reporting practice. Although it appears that there has been no significant effect on reporting practices care should be taken when undertaking time series analysis by grade. 

		<br><br></li><li>

Average age was calculated on actual age (as opposed to age groups) for staff with known age.

		<br><br></li><li>

Staff whose ethnicity is not known includes those who have been coded ‘information refused’.

		<br><br></li><li>

Non-UK nationality includes staff whose nationality has been coded ‘not known’.

		<br><br></li><li>

Due to the particular nature of the structure of the UHI Millennium Institute, teaching and research activities are carried out by its constituent partners, and these staff are therefore not returned by the institution.

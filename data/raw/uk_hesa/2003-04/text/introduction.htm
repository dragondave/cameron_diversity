Introduction

		</h2><p>
		
This publication is one of four reference volumes published annually by the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA). HESA is a company limited by guarantee, and is owned by the United Kingdom (UK) higher education sector through the representative bodies Universities UK and the Standing Conference of Principals. HESA collects data from publicly-funded higher education institutions (HEIs) in the UK on behalf of funding bodies and government departments, in a framework underpinned by legislation.

</p>
<p>

This volume brings together information about the finances and the staff of HEIs during the academic year 2003/04 that is, the period 1 August 2003 to 31 July 2004. It covers data supplied by 171 HEIs (133 in England, 14<a name="footnote1"></a><a href="#footnotes"><sup>1</sup></a> in Wales, 20 in Scotland, 4 in Northern Ireland). The data collection procedure is uniform across all institutions, regardless of size, nature and location. Tabulations are included that record and analyse income and expenditure, and the characteristics of staff, at the sector level in the printed volume, and on the CD also at the institutional level.

</p>
<p>
The other reference volumes published by HESA are as follows.
</p>
<p>
<i>Students in Higher Education Institutions</i>. This volume draws on HESA’s collection of data about students in HEIs. It includes information at the institutional level about entry qualifications, programmes taken and outcomes, together with background variables such as age, gender, ethnicity and disability. Data on HE provision in further education colleges (FECs) is not included in this volume except for students funded indirectly through HEIs, in which case it is reported by the HEI through which funding passes.
</p>
<p>
<i>Destinations of Leavers from Higher Education</i>. This volume draws on the Destinations of Leavers from HE (DLHE) survey and provides information about patterns of employment and further study or training at a point about six months after completion. DLHE covers leavers from part-time as well as full-time programmes.
</p>
<p>
<i>Higher Education Statistics for the United Kingdom</i>. This is the only HESA reference volume that currently falls within the National Statistics framework, and it accordingly carries the National Statistics logo as well as that of HESA. It provides an overview of higher education in the UK from a statistical perspective, including statistics about applications, participation, institutional finance, staffing, student awards and loans. To achieve this broad coverage, this volume draws on data collected by other bodies as well as HESA, and in particular includes some information about directly funded HE provision in FECs.
</p>
<p>
HESA also publishes annually two Statistical First Releases within the National Statistics framework; the Higher Education Management Statistics at sector and (on CD) institutional level and detailed data for institutional planning purposes on CD (HE Planning Plus and HE Finance Plus). Research Datapacks dealing with specific issues are produced on an occasional basis on CD. The HESA Information Provision Service exists to meet more specialist needs of data users on a bespoke basis.

</p><h2>

Data protection

</h2>
<p>

In order to comply with the provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Human Rights Act 1998, HESA implements a strategy in published and released tabulations designed to minimise the risk of disclosure of personal information about any individual. The tabulations in the volume are derived from the HESA non-statutory populations<a name="footnote2"></a><a href="#footnotes"><sup>2</sup></a> and may differ slightly from those published by related statutory bodies or in National Statistics publications. This strategy involves rounding all numbers to the nearest multiple of 5. A summary of this strategy is as follows:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
0, 1, 2 are rounded to 0
</li>
<li>
All other numbers are rounded to the nearest multiple of 5
</li>
</ol>
<p>
So for example 3 is represented as 5, 22 is represented as 20, 3286 is represented as 3285 while 0, 20, 55, 3510 remain unchanged.
</p>
<p>
This rounding strategy is also applied to total figures, the consequence of which is that the sum of numbers in each row or column will rarely match the total shown precisely. Note that subject level data calculated by apportionment will also be rounded in accordance with this strategy.
</p>
<p>
Average values, proportions and FTE values prepared by HESA will not usually be affected by the above strategy, and will be calculated on precise raw numbers.
</p>
<p>
Percentages calculated on populations which contain 52 or fewer individuals will be suppressed and represented as '..' as will averages based on populations of 7 or less.
</p>

<h2>
Format of publications

</h2><p>

Commencing with the 2002/03 cycle of publications, HESA reference volumes now comprise a relatively slim printed volume containing only a limited range of tables, together with a CD, which contains all the remaining data familiar to users from earlier years, supplemented with additional and more detailed tables. The tables on the CD are in Microsoft® Excel 2000 format. This has the further benefit of allowing users to select data from the tables and manipulate how it is displayed. However, arithmetical manipulations should be carried out with caution because of the effect of the rounding strategy described above.

</p>
<h2>
Finance data
</h2>
<p>
This commentary draws attention to some of the headline figures and key points that emerge from the main tables. The information is displayed graphically where appropriate. It should be noted that where comparisons are made between the latest financial year and a previous year, the figures for the previous year are as re-stated in the most recent financial statements available; any exceptions are noted explicitly. They are not therefore necessarily reconcilable with figures for that year published in previous HESA volumes. However, it is understood that all such figures can be reconciled to the published accounts of the institutions.
</p>
<p>
Because of rounding, published totals in finance tables may differ from the sum of the published figures that contribute to them.

<h2>
Summary of key points
</h2>

<h3>
Balance sheet
</h3>
<p>
Tangible assets have increased by £1,577 million (9.8%).
<p>
There has been a substantial increase of £314 million in short-term borrowing but also an increase of £178 million in short-term investments.
</p>
<h3>
Income and expenditure
</h3>
<p>
Income during the year amounted to £16.9 billion.
</p>
<p>
The surplus of income over expenditure was £241 million.
</p>
<h3>
Sources of income
</h3>
<p>
Funding council grants increased by £467 million (7.7%).
</p>
<p>
The amount of income received from tuition fees and education grants & contracts increased by 8.9%. EU domiciled students (including UK domiciled students) charged full-time HE course standard fees accounted for 33.3% of income from those sources.
</p>
<p>
Research councils provided 30.7% of research grants & contracts, the largest share of the total.
</p>
<h3>
Expenditure
</h3>
<p>
The £1,153 million (7.4%) rise in total expenditure was the result of broadly similar percentage rises in each of staff costs (£696 million), other operating expenses (£390 million) and depreciation, but there was very little increase in interest payable.
 </p>
<h2>
Balance sheet
</h2>
<p>
A comparison of the HE sector’s balance sheet at 31 July 2004 with that at 31 July 2003 shows a £314 million increase in short-term creditors while amounts due after more than one year have increased by £240 million. There was an increase of £96 million in debtors.
</p>
<p>
The value of tangible assets has increased by £1,577 million (9.8%), and endowment assets have increased by £181 million (7.6%). Endowments (specific and general) have also increased by £181 million from last year, compared with an increase of £34 million from 2002 to 2003.

To provide the context for these figures, Chart 1 shows the HE sector’s surplus/deficit (re-based and re-calculated as appropriate) for each of the years for which HESA now has data. Data were returned to HESA for financial year 1993/94 onwards; figures for these financial years are set out in earlier editions of this volume.
</p>

<p>

<p>
The number of institutions reporting a surplus or breakeven was 130 in 2003/04, compared with 122 in 2002/03; in each year the total number of reporting institutions was 171. Deficits in both financial years were reported by 21 institutions. 
</p>
<p>
The final table in this section aggregates figures for institutions funded by each of the four UK countries’ funding councils. It should be noted that in this and other tables, The Open University is counted as an institution based in England.

Funding council grants represent a 38.6% proportion of total income. Tuition fees and education grants & contracts represent a 24.2% proportion of total income. These proportions are very close to those for 2002/03. Previous years’ figures are those reported in the re-stated financial statements.
</p>
<h3>
Funding council grants
</h3>
<p>
Institutional funds for academic and other purposes are allocated primarily by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE), the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW), the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council (SHEFC) and by the Department for Employment and Learning for Northern Ireland (DELNI) acting as a funding agency for the four Northern Ireland higher education institutions. Some funds are also provided in England by the Department of Health (DH) and the Teacher Training Agency (TTA). In relation to some categories of FE teaching funding comes from the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) in England and Education and Training Wales (ELWa). (In Scotland it is impossible to disaggregate the funding of FE teaching.)

The clinical medicine cost centre and business & management studies cost centre continue to have the largest share of total expenditure on academic departments with 9.7% and 9.5% respectively, spending £670 million and £655 million in 2003/04. The social studies cost centre and nursing & paramedical studies cost centre have a 7.5% and 7.0% share of total expenditure respectively. They spent £518 million and £487 million in 2003/04.

<h2>
Staff data
</h2>
<p>
For the 2003/04 data collection, HESA replaced three separate staff returns (the Individualised Staff Return (ISR), the Aggregate Staff Return (ASR), and the New Aggregate Staff Return (NASR)) with a single new collection, the New Individualised Staff Return (NISR); the word ‘New’ will be dropped once there is no risk of confusion. 
</p>
<p>
As its name indicates, NISR is an individualised return. It covers all academic and non-academic staff who have a contract of employment with a higher education institution (HEI) in the UK, or for whom the HEI is liable to pay Class 1 National Insurance contributions. Other staff, such as those employed under consultancy contracts, or on the basis of payment of fees for services but without a contract of employment, are not included in the record. This is a major change from ISR which covered only staff with at least a 25% teaching and/or research commitment. The data previously collected on all academic staff activity by cost centre through ASR, and the equal opportunities monitoring data previously collected at an aggregate level on all staff through NASR, can broadly speaking be derived from NISR because of its full coverage, and this has made it possible to discontinue the use of separate returns to provide that information.
</p>
<p>
Within this record, staff designated as ‘academic’ include academic professionals who are responsible for preparing, directing and undertaking academic teaching and research within HE institutions and also medical practitioners, dentists, veterinarians and other health care professionals who undertake lecturing or research activities. By custom and practice a small number of other staff who do not have direct responsibility for the delivery of either teaching or research, including some institutional officers, are also designated as ‘academic’. All other staff in HEIs are designated as ‘non-academic’, and are grouped in twelve categories. In some tabulations these are combined into three broad-brush groups.
</p>
<p>
The amount of information collected on individual members of staff depends on the staff category into which they fall. Academic staff are recruited within a national, or indeed international, market, but one that is specialised by subject area. It is of value to be able to identify patterns of career progression as staff move from institution to institution, and to compare staffing resources with teaching and research commitments and funding streams. For such staff, the full record is collected. By contrast, for clerical, secretarial and manual staff, recruitment is from the labour market local to each institution. Although the individual institution may need to monitor its staffing position in considerable detail, the national data requirement is very limited, and is focused mainly on equal opportunities monitoring. For staff in these categories, the data collection is limited to a subset of the fields in the full record.
</p>
<p>
A key feature of the new HESA Staff Record is the format of collection. For the first time data can be analysed in terms of both people and employment contracts. The record consists of two tables. The person table contains one record for each person employed by an institution during the reporting period and contains attributes of the individual such as birth date, gender and ethnicity. Each person's employment with an institution will be governed by one or more legally-binding contracts and each contract that exists is recorded on the contract table. If a person has a single contract with the institution there will be one record on the person table and one record on the contract table. If a person has three contracts with an institution there will be one record on the person table and three records on the contract table.
</p>
<p>
The new Individualised Staff Return has introduced some definitional changes and refinements relative to previous collections, and NISR-derived figures from the staff record 2003/04 onwards are seldom exactly comparable with those for previous years. Three particular changes need mention. First, published figures now report staff with contracts active at 1 December, rather than reporting, as hitherto, the session population; this change is intended to avoid the over-counting, particularly of staff employed for a short period, inherent in the previous method. Secondly, academic staff are no longer categorised as clinical/non-clinical, so it is not possible to produce tabulations limited to non-clinical staff. Thirdly, tabulations will for the future generally include staff who are not wholly institutionally financed; in this volume a number of introductory tables have been produced both on this basis and on the previous basis limited to wholly institutionally-financed staff, so as to facilitate comparison with earlier years.
</p>
<p>
In addition, there are a number of transient effects due to the phasing-in of the full NISR collection. For 2003/04, institutions were not required to return data on ‘atypical’ staff. These are, broadly speaking, staff on contracts that qualify them for inclusion in NISR, but are not on a full-time or proportionate part-time basis. Such staff may be found throughout the sector, but form an important component of the total staffing in subject areas such as performing arts and fine art. Data on atypical staff will be collected from 2004/05 onwards. Also, there are some fields in the record where the exact definition of what is to be collected is still under discussion, and data from these fields is accordingly not yet available.
</p>
<p>
Analysis by staff grade is meaningful only where institutions have reported their staff within nationally recognised grade structures, or within internal grade structures that facilitate discrimination on a similar basis. Several institutions, including some large post-1992 universities, report their staff on a single grade structure lacking a separate category for the ‘Professor’ grade. Where this happens, Professors cannot be distinguished from staff on the Senior Lecturer (pre-1992) or Principal Lecturer (post-1992) grade, leading to Professors being zero-counted for those institutions and under-counted for the sector as a whole. This under-counting limits the scope of comparative analyses of the proportion of Professors within particular subject areas, by cost centres, by gender, and so on.
</p>

<h2>
Summary of key points
</h2>
<p>
In 2003/04 there were in total 227,525 full-time staff in the HE sector, of whom 44.7% were female, and 110,580 part-time staff, of whom 68.1% were female.
</p>
<p>
The total number of academic staff was 150,230, of whom 106,900 were full-time (47.0% of all full-time staff) and 43,330 were part-time (39.2% of all part-time staff). The number of full-time academic staff for 2002/03 recalculated on the new basis was 105,550; the corresponding 2003/04 figure is an increase of 1.3% on this.
</p>
<p>
Of all academic staff, 40.0% were female, but among part-time academic staff this percentage was higher at 52.2%.
</p>
<p>
Of all full-time academic posts, 70.6% were wholly financed by the institutions themselves.
</p>
<p>
Of full-time academic staff 92.3% were working in the same institution as in the previous year.
</p>
<p>
The average age of full-time academic staff was 42.5, and 40.3% were aged over 45.
</p>
<p>
Teaching as a primary employment function was included in 71.0% of full-time and 83.0% of part-time academic posts.
</p>
<p>
Ethnicity was reported for 88.1% of all staff. Of those of known ethnicity, 8.9% were drawn from ethnic minority groups. For academic staff the percentages were 86.2% and 10.5%. Both the overall proportion of ethnic minority staff, and the pattern on which different ethnic minority groups were represented, varied considerably by staff group.
</p>
<p>
Disability status was reported for 90.4% of all staff, and of those of known disability status, 2.4% had a disability. For academic staff, the percentages were 89.9% and 2.1%.
</p>
<p>
Among full-time academic staff, the proportion of professors who were female was 15.0%; of senior lecturers & researchers, 27.1%; of lecturers, 40.3% and of researchers, 41.7%.
</p>
<p>
Of all full-time academic staff, 25.7% were employed in medicine, dentistry, or health.
</p>
<p>
Of all research-only staff, 91.1% were employed on fixed-term contracts.

In 2003/04 (that is, on 1 December 2003) there were in total 227,525 full-time staff, of whom 44.7% were female, and 110,580 part-time staff, of whom 68.1% were female. Of the full-time staff, 47.0% were academic (group 2 in detailed tabulations), 26.1% were managerial, professional and technical (groups 1, 3, 4, 5, 6), 18.1% were secretarial and clerical (groups 7, 8), and 8.8% were manual (groups 9, 10, 11, 12). The corresponding figures for part-time staff were 39.2%, 16.8%, 20.8% and 23.2%.
</p>
<p>
Table L provides a breakdown of academic staffing in HE. The coverage of this table corresponds fairly closely to that of the table labelled as Table K in Resources volumes for previous years. The non-clinical/clinical split can no longer be made, but it is now possible to identify staff on fixed-term contracts.

In 2003/04, the total number of academic staff employed by UK HEIs was 150,230, of whom 106,900 (71.2%) were in full-time employment. Because of the change from a session population to a 1 December population, these numbers cannot be compared with those published for previous years, either in absolute or proportionate terms. However, it is possible to recalculate the number of full-time academic staff for 2002/03 on the new basis, and this gives a figure of 105,550; the corresponding 2003/04 figure is an increase of 1.3% on this.
</p>
<p>
While two-fifths (40.0%) of all academic staff were female, women comprised just over a half (52.2%) of those working part-time.
</p>
<p>
70.6% of full-time academic posts were wholly financed by the institutions themselves, this proportion rising to 84.1% for part-time posts.
</p>
<p>
70.1% of full-time academic posts and 83.0% of part-time academic posts included teaching as a primary employment function.

In 2003/04, 92.3% of full-time academic staff were working in the same institution as they had been in the previous academic year. A further 1.6% had been working in another HEI. The loss of 7,290 staff from the HE sector outnumbered the inflow of 6,455 staff. Outflow to the UK was the largest single known reason for departures and the sector gained more staff from overseas than left to work overseas. Caution should be exercised when further analysing staff flows on account of the size of the ‘Not known’ categories.
</p>
<p>
In the reference volumes for previous years, the corresponding table showed only the inflow and outflow of non-clinical staff who were wholly institutionally-financed. Although it is no longer possible to limit tabulations to non-clinical staff, it is possible to limit them to wholly institutionally-financed staff. To aid comparability with previous years, Table Mii and Chart 3ii have been produced on this basis.

Among wholly institutionally-financed staff retirement continued to be the largest single known reason for departures. The large reduction in this figure from 2002/03, where it is reported as 1,100, is a consequence of the move from a session population to a 1 December population; if the 2002/03 figure is recalculated on the new basis, it falls to 450, which is in the same range as the figure of 410 for 2003/04.

The average age of full-time academic staff was 42.5 and of part-time staff, 43.0 (from Table 23).

In the reference volumes for previous years the corresponding table showed the age distributions of non-clinical staff who were wholly institutionally-financed.

<p>
Of the staff included in Table Nii whose age was known, 50.1% were aged over 45 and 16.9% were aged between 51 and 55. Subject to caveats about the move to a 1 December population and the inclusion of clinical staff, these figures may be compared with those published for 2002/03, which were 49% and 17%, so no material change is apparent.

<h2>
Ethnicity of all staff
</h2>
<p>
In previous years information on ethnicity was available only for academic staff, but it is now possible to show the position for all staff. In Table P this is done by the four broad-brush staff groups and by mode of employment. The presentation of ethnicity data in this introductory section is not now limited to those of UK nationality, and this should be borne in mind if comparisons are made with figures published for previous years.

Of all staff, 88.1% reported their ethnicity. The response rate did not vary greatly by staff group and mode of employment, except for the low response rate of 74.7% from part-time academic staff. Among staff of known ethnicity, the proportion from ethnic minority groups varied considerably, with greater representation among academic staff at 10.5% than among non-academic staff at 7.7%.
</p>
<p>
Charts 4i to 4iv show the percentages of those from ethnic minorities represented by each visible ethnic minority group, for each of these four groups of staff. The pattern in each group is noticeably different.

<p>
At 90.7% for full-time staff and 92.8% for part-time staff, fixed-term contracts were the norm among research-only staff regardless of mode of employment. Among staff who had teaching responsibilities, the figures were 11.8% and 66.8% respectively, so fixed-term contracts were far commoner for part-time teaching staff. For female staff who had teaching responsibilities, the figures were 14.9% and 62.5% respectively, so the proportion of full-time female teaching staff on fixed-term contracts was somewhat higher than that of male staff, whereas there was little difference in the proportions for part-time staff.
</p>
<p>
Nearly four-fifths (79.1%) of teaching-only staff were part-time, compared with 17.5% for research-only staff and 14.8% for staff with both teaching and research duties.

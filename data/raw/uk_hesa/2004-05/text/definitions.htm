<h1>

Staff data

</h1>

<H4>

Coverage

		</H4><p>

The staff record provides data in respect of the characteristics of members of all academic and non-academic staff employed under a contract of employment by a higher education institution (HEI) in the UK.  <b>Academic staff</b> are defined as academic professionals who are responsible for planning, directing and undertaking academic teaching and research within HE institutions. They also include vice-chancellors, medical practitioners, dentists, veterinarians and other health care professionals who undertake lecturing or research activities.  <b>Non-academic staff </b> are defined as those that do not have an academic employment function such as managers, non-academic professionals, student welfare workers, secretaries, caretakers and cleaners. Staff employed under consultancy contracts, or on the basis of payment of fees for services, without a contract of employment, are not included in the record.

		</p><p>

The record is collected in two sections; the person table and the contract table. The person table contains one record for every person employed by an institution during the reporting period and contains attributes of the individual such as birth date, gender and ethnicity.  Each person's employment with an institution will be governed by a legally-binding contract and each contract that exists is recorded on the contract table. If a person has a single contract with the institution there will be one record on the person table and one record on the contract table. If a person has three contracts with an institution there will be one record on the person table and three records on the contract table.

		</p><p>

The 		<b>
HESA staff contract population 		</b>
is an indicator of those contracts that were active on 1 December within the reporting period. Atypical staff contracts are not counted in this population. Other staff with a default (or unknown) contract start date, a default (or unknown) contract end date and a contract FTE of zero are also not counted in this population. 

		</p><p>

The 		<b>
HESA staff contract session population 		</b>
is an indicator of those contracts that were active during the reporting period.  Atypical staff contracts are also counted in this population.  

		</p><p>

The    <b>
HESA staff atypical session population 		</b>
is an indicator of those individuals who had only atypical contracts that were active during the reporting period. Atypical staff contracts are those whose working arrangements are not permanent, involve complex employment relationships and/or involve work away from the supervision of the normal work provider.

		</p><h4>

Rounding strategy

		</h4><p>

Due to the provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Human Rights Act 1998, HESA implements a strategy in published and released tabulations designed to prevent the disclosure of personal information about any individual. These tabulations are derived from the HESA non-statutory populations<a name="footnote1"></a><a href="#footnotes"><sup>1</sup></a> and may differ slightly from those published by related statutory bodies. This strategy involves rounding all numbers to the nearest 5. A summary of this strategy is as follows:

		</p><ul><li>

0, 1, 2 are rounded to 0			

		</li><li>

All other numbers are rounded to the nearest 5	

		</li></ul><p>

So for example 3 is represented as 5, 22 is represented as 20, 3286 is represented as 3285 while 0, 20, 55, 3510 remain unchanged.

		</p><p>

Total figures are also subject to this rounding methodology; the consequence of which is that the sum of numbers in each row or column will rarely match the total shown precisely.

		</p><p>

Average values, proportions and FTE values prepared by HESA are not subject to the above strategy, and will be calculated on precise raw numbers. However, percentages calculated on populations which contain 52 or fewer individuals will be suppressed and represented as '..' as will averages based on populations of 7 or less.

    </p><p>

Data on financial affairs of higher education institutions does not fall within the definition of ‘personal data’ under the Data Protection Act 1998, and is therefore exempt from the above provisions.

		</p><h4>

Full-time equivalent

		</h4><p>

Full-time equivalent (FTE) is that recorded in the contract and measures the equivalence to full-time over the course of the reporting period 1 August to 31 July. The FTE is therefore counted using a population of staff who were active during the reporting period, not just on a given snapshot date (i.e. the HESA staff contract session population).

		</p><h4>

Full-person equivalent

    </h4><p>

Individuals can hold more than one contract with an institution and each contract may involve more than one different activity. In published analyses staff counts have been divided amongst their activities in proportion to the declared FTE for each activity. This results in counts of full person equivalents (FPE). Staff FPE counts are calculated on the basis of contract activities that were active on 1 December of the reporting period (using the HESA staff contract population).

    </p><h4>

Atypical full-person equivalent

    </h4><p>

Individuals can hold only atypical contracts with an institution and each contract involves only one activity. In published analyses staff counts have been divided amongst their activities in proportion to the declared FTE for each activity. This results in counts of full person equivalents (FPE). Atypical staff FPE counts are calculated on the basis of those individuals who have only atypical contracts that were active during the reporting period (using the HESA atypical staff population).

    </p><h4>

Mode of employment

		</h4><p><b>

Full-time </b>
staff are those whose contracts state that their mode of employment is full-time. This includes staff who work full-time for part of a year and term-time only staff who work full-time during the term.

    </p><p><b>

Part-time </b>
staff are those staff that work anything less than full-time. This includes the atypical category where institutions were unable to assign staff contracts to either the full-time or the part-time category.

    </p><p>

Mode of employment is an attribute of the contract, not the person. Therefore, a person will be counted as wholly part-time, even if they hold a number of part-time contracts that sum to one FTE. The FPE allocated to the full-time category will only reflect the people that hold a full-time contract. This is consistent with the treatment of other attributes of the contract.
 
		</p><h4>

Terms of employment

		</h4><p>

Terms of employment describes the type of contract/s a member of staff has with the institution at the date the data is returned to HESA or date of leaving if earlier. 

    </p><p><b>

Permanent 		</b>
staff are those who are employed on a contract of employment that states the member of staff as permanent or on an open-ended contract.  This includes term-time only staff who are employed on an open-ended contract.
 
		</p><p><b>

Fixed-term contract 		</b>
staff are those employed for a fixed period of time or have an end date on their contract of employment.  This includes staff on rolling fixed-term contracts.

		</p><p><b>

Atypical		</b>
staff are those whose working arrangements are not permanent, involve complex employment relationships and/or involve work away from the supervision of the normal work provider. These may be characterised by a high degree of flexibility for both the work provider and the working person, and may involve a triangular relationship that includes an agent. Source: DTI Discussion Document on Employment Status, July 2003, paragraph 23.

		</p><p>

In addition to this definition from the DTI, some HE specific guidance has been devised by HESA in consultation with institutions. Atypical contracts meet one or more of the following conditions:

    <ul><li>

are for less than four consecutive weeks - meaning that no statement of terms and conditions needs to be issued	

		</li><li>

are for one-off/short-term tasks - for example answering phones during clearing, staging an exhibition, organising a conference. There is no mutual obligation between the work provider and working person beyond the given period of work or project. In some cases individuals will be paid a fixed fee for the piece of work unrelated to hours/time spent

    </li><li>

involve work away from the supervision of the normal work provider - but not as part of teaching company schemes or for teaching and research supervision associated with the provision of distance learning education

    </li><li>

involve a high degree of flexibility often in a contract to work ‘as-and-when’ required - for example conference catering, student ambassadors, student demonstrators

    </li><li>

equate to less than 5% FTE during the reporting period (this condition only applies until 2005/06, after which there will be no FTE threshold). 

		</li></ul>

		<h4>

Source of basic salary

		</h4><p><b>

Wholly institutionally financed </b>
staff are those who are paid wholly from general institution funds.

		</p><p>

Staff <b>principally financed by the institution		</b>
are paid mainly from general institution funds and partly from another source. 

    <p><b>

Other sources of finance </b>
– these staff are paid mainly or wholly from sources other than general institution funds. These other sources include NHS/General Medical or General Dental practice or Department of Health, OST Research Councils, UK charities, UK central government bodies and local authorities, UK industry, commerce & public corporations, EU sources, other overseas sources and other sources not listed. 

		</p><p>

Where <b>All other sources of finance</b> appears in conjunction with <b>Wholly institutionally financed</b> it should be taken to mean <b>Principally financed by the institution</b> plus <b>Other sources of finance</b>.

		</p><h4>

Academic employment function

		</h4><p>

The academic employment function of a member of staff relates to the contract of employment and not the actual work undertaken.  

    <p><b>

Teaching only </b>
staff are those whose contracts of employment state that they are employed only to undertake teaching.

    </p><p><b>

Teaching & research </b>
staff are those whose contracts of employment state that they are employed to undertake both teaching and research. 

    </p><p><b>

Research only </b>
staff are those whose contracts of employment state that they are employed only to undertake research. 

    </p><p><b>

Neither teaching nor research </b>
staff are those whose academic employment function is neither teaching nor research, e.g. Vice Chancellor.

		</p><h4>
 
Grade (academic staff only)

		</h4><p>

The grade structure indicates a staff member’s grade for a particular contract of employment. Groups of grades have been devised with regard to the different grading scales used within different institutions. Grades have not, however, been linked to salary information. 

		</p><p><b>

Professors		</b>
includes heads of departments, professors, former UAP scale researchers (grade IV), clinical professors and those appointed professors on a locally determined scale. 

		</p><p><b>

Senior lecturers & researchers </b>
includes principal lecturers, senior lecturers (former UAP/CSCFC scales), former UAP scale researchers (grade III), clinical senior lecturers and those appointed senior or principal lecturers on a locally determined scale. 

    </p><p><b>

Lecturers </b>
includes lecturers, senior lecturers (former PCEF scale), clinical lecturers and those appointed lecturers on a locally determined scale. 

    </p><p><b>

Researchers </b>
includes all research grades not listed above and those researchers appointed on a locally determined scale. 

    </p><p><b>

Other grades </b>
includes other grades of academic staff not listed above. 

    </p><p>

Analysis by ‘staff grade’ is only meaningful where institutions have reported their staff within nationally recognised grade structures or within internal grade structures which facilitate differentiation on a similar basis. 

    </p><p>

Several institutions, including some large post-1992 universities, report their academic staff on a single grade structure, which does not have an independent category for the professor grade. Hence staff on the professor grade at institutions using the single grade scale cannot be distinguished from the senior lecturer grade, leading to the number of professors being under-counted for these institutions and for the sector as a whole. This under-counting will have a consequential effect on the proportions of professors within particular subject areas, cost centres and by gender. 

    </p><p>

No attempt has been made to collect grade information for non-academic staff as the wide range of grade structures used up to now in institutions could not straightforwardly or meaningfully be mapped to a set of national grades. 

    </p><p>

Additionally, with the implementation of the Joint Negotiating Committee for HE Staff (JINCHES) agreement, institutions will be negotiating grade structures for all staff locally against a nationally agreed pay spine. An increasing number of institutions will therefore be moving away from nationally recognised grade structures from 2004 onwards. New methods for recording and monitoring grade nationally will have to be developed, but these will need to reflect a yet unknown reality. Consequently in the short term recording of grade will not be possible in all institutions even for academic staff. 

    </p><p>

The Agency therefore advises caution in analysis of staff by grade.

Cost centres have been assigned into cost centre groups, which reflect both academic similarities and comparable resource requirements.

Ethnicity

		</h4><p>

It is HESA’s intention to adopt national classifications where they exist and are appropriate. However, in this instance, there is no coding structure for ethnicity that is applicable throughout the UK, as variations to the Census 2001 ethnicity coding were adopted in both Scotland and Northern Ireland. To accommodate requirements for institutions in these regions to report locally to their devolved administrations, the coding frame has been revised. 

    </p><p>

Staff may choose not to reveal their ethnicity and therefore HESA advises that the figures reported in analyses are derived from a subset which may not be representative of the total staff population.

    </p><p>

The following entries have been grouped together and this may mean that the ethnicity groupings used in previous years may not now be comparable:

    </p><p>

The ethnic category ‘White’ includes the entries: <br>
      
      White  <br>
      White - British <br>
      White - Irish <br>
      White - Scottish <br>
      Irish Traveller <br>
      Other White background. <br>

    </p><p>

The ethnic category ‘Other (including mixed)’ includes the entries: <br>

      Mixed - White and Black Caribbean <br>
      Mixed - White and Black African <br>
      Mixed - White and Asian <br>
      Other Mixed background <br>
      Other Ethnic background.<br>

		</p><h4>

Disability

		</h4><p>

Disability categories indicate the type of disability that a member of staff has on the basis of their own self-assessment and are consistent with those used in respect of HE students. Staff are not obliged to report a disability and as a result some institutions have not returned disability data for some of their staff. HESA therefore advises that the figures reported in analyses are derived from a subset which may not be representative of the total staff population. 

		</p><h4>

Nationality

		</h4><p><b>

Nationality </b>
defines the country of legal nationality.  Data is supplied to HESA in the form of country codes which are mapped to geographical regions following consultation with the Department for Education and Skills. 

    </p><p><b>

UK nationality </b>
staff are those whose country of legal nationality is the UK, including the Channel Islands and Isle of Man.

    </p><p><b>

Non-UK nationality </b>
staff are those whose country of legal nationality is a country other than the UK.

		</p><h4>

Location of institution

		</h4><p>

The allocation of an institution to a geographical region relates only to the administrative centre of that institution. There may be staff employed at institutions who are working in regions other than that of the administrative centre of the institution.  

    </p><p>

The Open University is counted as a wholly English institution. Their administrative centre is located in England, although the Open University teaches throughout the UK. 

		</p><h4>

SOC - Occupational coding for higher education staff

		</h4><p>

The Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) provides a national standard for categorising occupational information. SOC forms the basis of occupational classification in a variety of national surveys that collect statistical information such as the Labour Force Survey and New Earnings Survey. The utilisation of SOC for classifying occupations within the HE sector therefore both allows for the heterogeneity of occupations that exist and enables comparisons to be made with other sectors of the economy and from a variety of data sources.

    </p><p>

However, some difficulties emerge in the direct application of SOC for occupational coding within the HE sector. At the most aggregate level, SOC distinguishes nine broad categories termed Major Groups. The titles associated with these Major Groups, which by necessity have to be general in their nature to encompass all occupations, do not provide an intuitive method of classifying the occupations within HE. Additionally, the coding manuals of the Standard Occupational Classification contain information on many occupations and job titles that are not relevant to the HE sector. 

    </p><p>

The classification of occupations within higher education has therefore necessitated the development of a variant of the national standard that is relevant for the HE sector. This enables the classification of job titles found within the HE sector to fall into one of 13 broad occupational categories: <br><br></p>

Academic</b> 
staff are defined as academic professionals who are responsible for planning, directing and undertaking academic teaching and research within HE institutions. They also include vice-chancellors, medical practitioners, dentists, veterinarians and other health care professionals who undertake lecturing or research activities. All academic staff fall into group 2A of the SOC classification, regardless of their discipline (e.g. science, engineering, social sciences, humanities, languages).

    </p><p><b>

Non-academic</b> 
staff are defined as members of staff who fall into one of the remaining 12 occupational categories such as managers, non-academic professionals, student welfare workers, secretaries, caretakers and cleaners.

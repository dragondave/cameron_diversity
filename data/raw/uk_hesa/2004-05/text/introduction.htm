Introduction

		</h2><p>
This publication is one of four reference volumes published annually by
the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA). HESA is a company
limited by guarantee, and is owned by the United Kingdom (UK) higher
education sector through the representative bodies Universities UK and
the Standing Conference of Principals. HESA collects data from
publicly-funded higher education institutions (HEIs) in the UK on
behalf of funding bodies and government departments, in a framework
underpinned by legislation.
</p>
<p>This volume brings together information about the finances and the
staff of HEIs during the academic year 2004/05 that is, the period 1
August 2004 to 31 July 2005. It covers data supplied by 168 HEIs (131
in England, 13<a name="footnote1"></a><a href="#footnotes"><sup>1</sup></a>
in Wales, 20 in Scotland, 4 in Northern Ireland). The data collection
procedure is uniform across all institutions, regardless of size,
nature and location. Tabulations are included that record and analyse
income and expenditure, and the characteristics of staff, at the sector
level in the printed volume, and on the CD also at the institutional
level.
</p>
<p>
The other reference volumes published by HESA are as follows.
</p>
<p>
<i>Students in Higher Education Institutions</i>. This volume draws on
HESA’s collection of data about students in HEIs. It includes
information at the institutional level about entry qualifications,
programmes taken and outcomes, together with background variables such
as age, gender, ethnicity and disability. Data on HE provision in
further education colleges (FECs) is not included in this volume except
for students funded indirectly through HEIs, in which case it is
reported by the HEI through which funding passes.
</p>
<p>
<i>Destinations of Leavers from Higher Education</i>. TThis volume
draws on the Destinations of Leavers from HE (DLHE) survey and provides
information about patterns of employment and further study or training
at a point about six months after completion. DLHE covers leavers from
part-time as well as full-time programmes.
</p>
<p>
<i>Higher Education Statistics for the United Kingdom</i>. This is the
only HESA reference volume that currently falls within the National
Statistics framework, and it accordingly carries the National
Statistics logo as well as that of HESA. It provides an overview of
higher education in the UK from a statistical perspective, including
statistics about applications, participation, institutional finance,
staffing, student awards and loans. To achieve this broad coverage,
this volume draws on data collected by other bodies as well as HESA,
and in particular includes some information about directly funded HE
provision in FECs.
</p>
<p>HESA also publishes annually two Statistical First Releases within
the National Statistics framework; the Higher Education Management
Statistics at institutional level (on CD) and detailed data for
institutional planning purposes on CD (HE Planning Plus and HE Finance
Plus). Research Datapacks dealing with specific issues are produced on
an occasional basis on CD. The HESA Information Provision Service
exists to meet more specialist needs of data users on a bespoke basis.
</p><h2>

Data protection

</h2>
<p>In order to comply with the provisions of the Data Protection Act
1998 and the Human Rights Act 1998, HESA implements a strategy in
published and released tabulations designed to minimise the risk of
disclosure of personal information about any individual. The
tabulations in this volume are derived from the HESA non-statutory
populations<a name="footnote2"></a><a href="#footnotes"><sup>2</sup></a>
and may differ slightly from those published by related statutory
bodies or in National Statistics publications. This strategy involves
rounding all numbers to the nearest multiple of 5. A summary of this
strategy is as follows:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
0, 1, 2 are rounded to 0
</li>
<li>
All other numbers are rounded to the nearest multiple of 5
</li>
</ol>
<p>So for example 3 is represented as 5, 22 is represented as 20, 3286
is represented as 3285 while 0, 20, 55, 3510 remain unchanged.
</p>
<p>This rounding strategy is also applied to total numbers; the
consequence of this is that the sum of numbers in each row or column
rarely matches the total shown precisely. Note that subject level data
calculated by apportionment is also rounded in accordance with this
strategy.
</p>
<p>Average values, proportions and FTE values prepared by HESA are not
usually affected by the above strategy, and are calculated on precise
raw numbers.
</p>
<p>Percentages calculated on populations which contain 52 or fewer
individuals are suppressed and represented as '..' as are averages
based on populations of 7 or fewer.
</p>

<h2>
Format of publications

</h2><p>Commencing with the 2002/03 cycle of publications, HESA
reference volumes comprise a relatively slim printed volume containing
only a limited range of tables, together with a CD, which contains all
the remaining data familiar to users from earlier years, supplemented
with additional and more detailed tables. The tables on the CD are in
Microsoft® Excel 2000 format. This has the further benefit of allowing
users to select data from the tables and manipulate how it is
displayed. However, arithmetical manipulations should be carried out
with caution because of the effect of the rounding strategy described
above.
</p>
<h2>
Finance data
</h2>
<p>This commentary draws attention to some of the headline figures and
key points that emerge from the main tables. The information is
displayed graphically where appropriate. It should be noted that where
comparisons are made between the latest financial year and a previous
year, the figures for the previous year are as re-stated in the most
recent financial statements available; any exceptions are noted
explicitly. They are not therefore necessarily reconcilable with
figures for that year published in previous HESA volumes. However, it
is understood that all such figures can be reconciled to the published
accounts of the institutions.
</p>
<p>Because of rounding, published totals in finance tables may differ
from the sum of the published figures that contribute to them.
</p>
<h2>
Summary of key points
</h2>

<h3>
Balance sheet
</h3>
<p>
Tangible assets have increased by £1,698 million (9.6%).
</p><p>
There has been an increase of £422 million in short-term borrowing but a decrease of £106 million in short-term investments.
</p>
<h3>
Income and expenditure
</h3>
<p>
Income during the year amounted to £18.0 billion.
</p>
<p>
The surplus of income over expenditure was £213 million.
</p>
<h3>
Sources of income
</h3>
<p>
Funding council grants increased by £444 million (6.8%).
</p>
<p>The amount of income received from tuition fees and education grants
&amp; contracts increased by 5.9%. EU domiciled students (including UK
domiciled students) charged full-time HE course standard fees accounted
for 32.8% of income from those sources.
</p>
<p>
Research councils provided 32.1% of research grants &amp; contracts, the largest share of the total.
</p>
<h3>
Expenditure
</h3>
<p>The £1,121 million (6.7%) rise in total expenditure was the result
of broadly similar percentage rises in each of staff costs (£627
million), other operating expenses (£402 million) and interest payable,
but there was a larger percentage increase of 9.8% (£78 million) in
depreciation. </p>
<h2>
Balance sheet
</h2>
<p>
A comparison of the HE sector’s balance sheet at 31 July 2005 with that
at 31 July 2004 shows a £422 million increase in short-term creditors
while amounts due after more than one year have increased by £184
million. There was an increase of £206 million in debtors.
</p>
<p>The value of tangible assets has increased by £1,698 million (9.6%),
and endowment assets have increased by £483 million (17.9%). Endowments
(specific and general) have also increased by £483 million from last
year, compared with an increase of £181 million from 2003 to 2004.

<p>To provide the context for these figures, Chart 1 shows the HE
sector’s surplus/deficit (re-based and re-calculated as appropriate)
for each of the years for which HESA now has data. These are cash
figures to which no deflator has been applied. Data were returned to
HESA for financial year 1993/94 onwards; figures for these financial
years are set out in earlier editions of this volume.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>The number of institutions reporting a surplus or breakeven was 124
out of 168 in 2004/05, compared with 130 out of 171 in 2003/04.
Deficits in both financial years were reported by 23 institutions.
</p>
<p>The final table in this section aggregates figures for institutions
funded by each of the four UK countries’ funding councils. It should be
noted that in this and other tables, The Open University is counted as
an institution based in England, although its funding now includes
contributions from other administrations.

Funding council grants represent a 38.7% proportion of total income.
Tuition fees &amp; education grants &amp; contracts represent a 24.1%
proportion of total income. These proportions are very close to those
for 2003/04. Previous years’ figures are those reported in the
re-stated financial statements.
</p>
<h3>
Funding council grants
</h3>
<p>Institutional funds for academic and other purposes are allocated
primarily by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE),
the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW), the Scottish
Further and Higher Education Funding Council (SFC) [formerly the
Scottish Higher Education Funding Council (SHEFC), now merged with the
former Scottish Further Education Funding Council (SFEFC) and known as
the Scottish Funding Council] and by the Department for Employment and
Learning for Northern Ireland (DELNI) acting as a funding agency for
the four Northern Ireland higher education institutions. Some funds are
also provided in England by the Department of Health (DH) and the
Training and Development Agency for Schools (TDA) [formerly the Teacher
Training Agency (TTA)]. In relation to some categories of FE teaching
funding comes from the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) in England and
Education and Training Wales (ELWa) [now absorbed into the National
Assembly for Wales (NAW)]. In Scotland it is impossible to disaggregate
the funding of FE teaching.

<p>The clinical medicine cost centre and business &amp; management
studies cost centre continue to have the largest share of total
expenditure on academic departments with 10.0% and 9.6% respectively,
spending £742 million and £717 million in 2004/05. The social studies
cost centre and nursing &amp; paramedical studies cost centre have a
7.7% and 6.9% share of total expenditure respectively. They spent £571
million and £511 million in 2004/05. These numbers are derived from the
Total UK row of Table 2d.
</p>

<h2>
Staff data
</h2>
<p>For the 2003/04 data collection, HESA replaced three separate staff
records (the Individualised Staff Record (ISR), the Aggregate Staff
Record (ASR), and the New Aggregate Staff Record (NASR)) with a single
new collection, the New Individualised Staff Record (NISR); the word
‘New’ will be dropped once there is no risk of confusion. The 2004/05
data collection is accordingly the second collection using NISR.
</p>
<p>As its name indicates, NISR is an individualised record. It covers
all academic and non-academic staff who have a contract of employment
with a higher education institution (HEI) in the UK, or for whom the
HEI is liable to pay Class 1 National Insurance contributions. Other
staff, such as those employed under consultancy contracts, or on the
basis of payment of fees for services but without a contract of
employment, are not included in the record. This is a major change from
ISR which covered only staff with at least a 25% teaching and/or
research commitment. The data previously collected on all academic
staff activity by cost centre through ASR, and the equal opportunities
monitoring data previously collected at an aggregate level on all staff
through NASR, can broadly speaking be derived from NISR because of its
full coverage, and this has made it possible to discontinue the use of
separate returns to provide that information.
</p>
<p>Within this record, staff designated as ‘academic’ include academic
professionals who are responsible for preparing, directing and
undertaking academic teaching and research within HE institutions and
also medical practitioners, dentists, veterinarians and other health
care professionals who undertake lecturing or research activities. By
custom and practice, a small number of other staff who do not have
direct responsibility for the delivery of either teaching or research,
including some institutional officers, are also designated as
‘academic’. All other staff in HEIs are designated as ‘non-academic’,
and are grouped in twelve categories. In some tabulations these are
combined into three broad-brush groups.
</p>
<p>The amount of information collected on individual members of staff
depends on the staff category into which they fall. Academic staff are
recruited within a national, or indeed international, market, but one
that is specialised by subject area. It is of value to be able to
identify patterns of career progression as staff move from institution
to institution, and to compare staffing resources with teaching and
research commitments and funding streams. For such staff, the full
record is collected. By contrast, for clerical, secretarial and manual
staff, recruitment is from the labour market local to each institution.
Although the individual institution may need to monitor its staffing
position in considerable detail, the national data requirement is very
limited and is focused mainly on equal opportunities monitoring. For
staff in these categories, the data collection is limited to a subset
of the fields in the full record.
</p>
<p>A key feature of the new HESA Individualised Staff Record is the
format of collection. For the first time data can be analysed in terms
of both people and employment contracts. The record consists of two
tables. The person table contains one record for each person employed
by an institution during the reporting period and contains attributes
of the individual such as birth date, gender and ethnicity. Each
person's employment with an institution is governed by one or more
legally-binding contracts and each contract that exists is recorded on
the contract table. If a person has a single contract with the
institution there will be one record on the person table and one record
on the contract table. If a person has three contracts with an
institution there will be one record on the person table and three
records on the contract table.
</p>
<p>The new HESA Individualised Staff Record has introduced some
definitional changes and refinements relative to previous collections,
and figures derived from the staff record from 2003/04 onwards are
seldom exactly comparable with those for previous years. Three
particular changes need mention. First, published figures now report
staff with contracts active at 1 December, rather than reporting, as
hitherto, the session population; this change is intended to avoid the
over-counting, particularly of staff employed for a short period,
inherent in the previous method. Secondly, academic staff are no longer
categorised as clinical/non-clinical, so it is not possible to produce
tabulations limited to non-clinical staff. Thirdly, tabulations will
for the future generally include staff who are not wholly
institutionally financed; in this volume a number of introductory
tables have been produced both on this basis and on the previous basis
limited to wholly institutionally-financed staff, so as to facilitate
comparison with earlier years.
</p>
<p>In addition, there are a number of transient effects due to the
phasing-in of the full NISR collection. For 2003/04, institutions were
not required to return data on ‘atypical’ staff. These are, broadly
speaking, staff on contracts that qualify them for inclusion in NISR,
but are not on a full-time or proportionate part-time basis. Such staff
may be found throughout the sector, but form an important component of
the total staffing in subject areas such as performing arts and fine
art. Data on atypical staff were collected for the first time for
2004/05, and in order to make it possible to present this material,
some of the tables and charts in this 2004/05 volume have been enhanced
by comparison with 2003/04. However, information on staff other than
atypicals is comparable with that for 2003/04. Also, there are some
fields in the record where the exact definition of what is to be
collected is still under discussion, and data from these fields is
accordingly not yet available.
</p>
<p>Analysis by staff grade is meaningful only where institutions have
reported their staff within nationally recognised grade structures, or
within internal grade structures that facilitate discrimination on a
similar basis. Several institutions, including some large post-1992
universities, report their staff on a single grade structure lacking a
separate category for the ‘Professor’ grade. Where this happens,
Professors cannot be distinguished from staff on the Senior Lecturer
(pre-1992) or Principal Lecturer (post-1992) grade, leading to
Professors being zero-counted for those institutions and under-counted
for the sector as a whole. This under-counting limits the scope of
comparative analyses of the proportion of Professors within particular
subject areas, by cost centres, by gender, and so on.

Summary of key points
</h2>
<p>
Staff numbers are full-person equivalents unless otherwise specified.
</p>
<p>In 2004/05 there were in total 234,440 (2003/04: 227,525) full-time
staff in the HE sector, of whom 45.5% (44.7%) were female, and 111,865
(110,580) part-time staff, of whom 67.9% (68.1%) were female. Also,
reported for the first time in 2004/05, there were 164,550 atypical
staff, of whom 49.9% were female.
</p>
<p>Of all academic staff other than atypicals, 41.2% (40.0%) were
female; for full time academic staff the proportion was 36.1%
(35.1%)and for part-time academic staff, 52.1% (52.2%). The proportion
of atypical academic staff who were female was 45.3%.
</p>
<p>The total (full-person-equivalent) number of academic staff other
than atypicals was 160,655 (150,230), of whom 109,625 (106,900) were
full-time, constituting 46.8% (47.0%) of all full-time staff, and
51,030 (43,330) were part-time, constituting 45.6% (39.2%) of all
part-time staff. There were 81,795 atypical academic staff,
constituting 49.7% of all atypical staff. The number of full-time
academic staff for 2002/03 recalculated on the new basis was 105,550;
the corresponding 2003/04 figure was an increase of 1.3% on this, and
the figure for 2004/05 was a further increase of 2.5%.
</p>
<p>
Of all full-time academic posts, 72.0% (70.6%) were wholly financed by the institutions themselves.
</p>
<p>Teaching as a primary employment function was included in 71.4%
(71.0%) of full-time and 86.3% (83.0%) of part-time academic posts.
</p>
<p>
The average age of full-time academic staff was 42.7 (42.5), and 40.6% (40.3%) were aged over 45.
</p>
<p>Ethnicity was reported for 89.5% (88.1%) of all full- and part-time
staff. Of those of known ethnicity, 9.2% (8.9%) were drawn from ethnic
minority groups. For academic staff the percentages were 88.1% (86.2%)
and 10.4% (10.5%). Both the overall proportion of ethnic minority
staff, and the pattern on which different ethnic minority groups were
represented, varied considerably by staff group. Ethnicity was reported
for 40.7% of atypical staff, and, of those of known ethnicity, 15.4%
were from ethnic minority groups.
</p>
<p>Disability status was reported for 90.5% (90.4%) of all full- and
part-time staff, and of those of known disability status, 2.4% (2.4%)
had a disability. For full- and part-time academic staff, the
percentages were 90.0% (89.9%) and 2.1% (2.1%). For atypical staff, the
percentages were 73.0% and 1.0%.
</p>
<p>Among full-time academic staff, the proportion of Professors who
were female was 15.8% (15.0%); of Senior lecturers &amp; researchers,
29.0% (27.1%); of Lecturers, 41.8% (40.3%) and of Researchers, 42.2%
(41.7%).
</p>
<p>
Of all full-time academic staff, 26.0% (25.7%) were employed in medicine, dentistry, or health.
</p>
<p>
Of all research-only staff, 88.9% (91.1%) were employed on fixed-term contracts.

<p>In 2004/05 (that is, on 1 December 2004) there were in total 234,440
full-time staff, of whom 45.5% were female, 111,865 part-time staff, of
whom 67.9% were female, and 164,550 atypical staff, of whom 49.9% were
female. Of the full-time staff, 46.8% were academic (group 2 in
detailed tabulations), 26.4% were managerial, professional and
technical (groups 1, 3, 4, 5, 6), 18.2% were secretarial and clerical
(groups 7, 8), and 8.6% were manual (groups 9, 10, 11, 12, 13<a name="footnote3"></a><a href="#footnotes"><sup>3</sup></a>
The corresponding figures for part-time staff were 45.6%, 11.2%, 21.0% and
22.1%, and for atypical staff, 49.7%, 13.4%, 22.4% and 14.5%. The
numbers in Table K are full-person equivalents, and for most purposes
it is not useful to compare absolute numbers across the three different
modes of employment. When comparing proportions, it should be borne in
mind that among part-time staff, and probably to an even greater extent
among atypical staff, the full-time-equivalent weighting of individuals
varies greatly and may be correlated with the group into which they
fall.
</p>
<p>41.2% of all academic staff other than atypicals were female, women
comprised 36.1% of those working full-time and 52.1% of those working
part-time. Of atypical academic staff, 45.3% were female.
</p>
<p>Table L provides a breakdown of academic staffing in HE excluding
atypicals. The reason for this exclusion is that the factors by which
numbers are broken down in the rows of this table are not recorded for
atypicals, with the exception of gender where the information is
available in Table K. The coverage of Table L corresponds fairly
closely to that of the table labelled as Table K in Resources volumes
up to 2002/03. The non-clinical/clinical split can no longer be made,
but from 2003/04 onwards it has become possible to identify staff on
fixed-term contracts.

<p>In 2004/05, the total number of academic staff other than atypicals
employed by UK HEIs was 160,655, of whom 109,625, or 68.2% were in
full-time employment. Because of the change from a session population
to a 1 December population, these numbers cannot be compared with those
published up to 2002/03, either in absolute or proportionate terms.
However, it is possible to recalculate the number of full-time academic
staff for 2002/03 on the new basis, and this gives a figure of 105,550;
the corresponding 2003/04 figure was an increase of 1.3% on this, and
the figure for 2004/05 was a further increase of 2.5%.
</p>
<p>72.0% of full-time academic posts were wholly financed by the
institutions themselves, this proportion rising to 87.3% for part-time
posts.
</p>
<p>
71.4% of full-time academic posts and 86.3% of part-time academic posts included teaching as a primary employment function.
</p>

<h2>
Inflow/outflow of full-time academic staff
</h2>
<p>Tables 14a and 14b give details of the inflow and outflow of
academic staff during the year. For a variety of reasons, it would be
extremely difficult to draw out from those tables any easily understood
human capital balance sheet for academic staff. Table M achieves this
by presenting numbers on a different basis, for headcount (used only in
Table M) rather than full-person-equivalent (used in other contexts)
full-time academic staff only. This results in numbers that are very
slightly different from those in Table L. Table M is not comparable
with tables produced in previous years.

<p>With the introduction of NISR, the presentation of staff numbers was
changed to a 1 December snapshot basis. For 2004/05 it is for the first
time possible to compare numbers in two such snapshots and to break
down the change in total numbers, so Table M involves linkage between
the staff records for 2003/04 and 2004/05. Starting from the number of
full-time academic staff as at 1 December 2003, the number who can also
be identified as full-time at the same institution on 1 December 2004
is determined, as is the number who have moved from full-time to
part-time mode at the same institution. The balance is the number that
have left their previous institution (or are still there but are no
longer full- or part-time academic staff) during the year. Similarly,
the number of full-time academic staff as at 1 December 2004 is
determined, as is the number who have moved from part-time-to full-time
mode at the same institution. From this, the number that have joined
their current institution from outside during the year (or become
full-time academic staff from some status other than part-time academic
staff) is derived. This provides the overall structure of the balance
sheet. The (headcount) number of full-time academic staff has increased
from 107,135 at 1 December 2003 to 109,910 at 1 December 2004, an
increase of 2.6%. Of those in post as at 1 December 2004, 89,340, or
81.3%, were full-time (and a further 3,020, or 2.7%, were part-time)
academic staff at the same institution a year previously (note again
that this is not on the same basis as the percentage quoted in previous
years).
</p>
<p>Although the table also gives a breakdown of starters and leavers,
regrettably the very large proportion of unknowns, particularly in the
case of leavers, means that no conclusions can safely be drawn from the
breakdowns. For example, leavers going to other institutions in the HE
sector and starters coming from other institutions in the HE sector
might be expected to balance across the sector, although moves between
full-time and part-time status will make this balance only approximate,
but under-reporting has resulted in widely different numbers. For the
same reason, it is unsafe to draw any conclusions about the ‘brain
drain/gain’.

<p>In the reference volumes up to 2002/03, the corresponding table
showed only the age distribution of non-clinical staff who were wholly

limit tabulations to non-clinical staff, but it is possible to limit
them to wholly institutionally-financed staff. To aid comparability

<p>Of the staff included in Table Nii whose age was known, 49.6% were
aged over 45 and 16.1% were aged between 51 and 55, for 2003/04 these
percentages were 50.1% and 16.9% respectively. Subject to caveats about
the move to a 1 December population and the inclusion of clinical
staff, these figures may be compared with those published for 2002/03,
which were 49% and 17%, so no material change is apparent over the

the coverage by mode extends to atypical staff as well as full- and
part-time staff. In Table P ethnicity is shown broken down by the four
broad-brush staff groups and by mode of employment. The layout is
designed to facilitate comparisons with the corresponding table for
2003/04. The presentation of ethnicity data in this introductory
section is not now limited to those of UK nationality, and this should
be borne in mind if comparisons are made with figures published for
previous years.

<p>Of all full- and part-time staff, 89.5% reported their ethnicity.
The response rate did not vary greatly by staff group and mode of
employment, with the previously low response rate of 74.7% from
part-time academic staff in 2003/04 having increased to 81.7% in
2004/05. Among staff of known ethnicity, the proportion from ethnic
minority groups varied considerably, with greater representation among
academic staff at 10.4% than among non-academic staff at 8.2%.
</p>
<p>Ethnicity was reported for only 40.7% of atypical staff. This low
proportion is probably a consequence of the newness of the reporting
requirement, with institutional staff record systems not yet fully
adapted to collect the necessary data at the time of appointment and
retrospective collection from staff on such contracts being
impracticable. It may be expected to increase substantially in future.
Of those atypical staff of known ethnicity, 15.4% were from ethnic
minority groups.
</p>

<p>Charts 3i to 3iv show the percentages of those from ethnic
minorities represented by each visible ethnic minority group, for each
of these four groups of full- and part-time staff. Charts 3v and 3vi
show the position for atypical staff, broken down between academic and
non-academic staff. The pattern in each group is noticeably different.

<p>36.9% of female and 19.9% of male full-time academic staff worked in
medicine, dentistry &amp; health. The biological, mathematical &amp;
physical science departments accounted for 20.5% of male full-time
academic staff.
</p>
<p>45.9% of full-time academic staff in medicine, dentistry &amp;
health and 43.5% in biological, mathematical &amp; physical sciences
were financed other than wholly by the institutions themselves. Cost
centre groups with the fewest partially or wholly externally funded
full-time academic staff were in the areas of design, creative and
performing arts (4.2%), humanities and language based studies and
archaeology (9.3%), education (9.8%) and administration, business and
social studies (9.9%). These cost centre groups are different from
those used last year and so these figures are not strictly comparable
with those in last year’s introduction. The Definitions at the end of
this volume describe the new cost centre groups.

<p>
At 88.8% for full-time staff and 89.7% for part-time staff, fixed-term
contracts were the norm among research-only staff regardless of mode of
employment, although these percentages have fallen slightly since
2003/04. Among staff who had teaching responsibilities, the figures
were 12.1% and 60.2% respectively, so fixed-term contracts were far
commoner for part-time teaching staff. For female staff who had
teaching responsibilities, the figures were 15.3% and 56.5%
respectively, so the proportion of full-time female teaching staff on
fixed-term contracts was somewhat higher than that of male staff,
whereas there was little difference in the proportions for part-time
staff.
</p>
<p>80.5% of teaching-only staff were part-time, compared with 16.4% for
research-only staff and 14.9% for staff with both teaching and research
duties.

<br><br></li><li>

The financial data supplied by the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) is extracted from the RCN audited accounts based on an April to March accounting year. This information is consistent with note 18 in the accounts which specifically refers to the results of RCN. Income and expenditure relating to the RCN is fairly consistent month on month, therefore inconsistencies with data relating to the August to July reporting period should be minimal. 

 <br><br></li><li>

The University of Buckingham publishes audited accounts to 31 December each year. Consequently, the income and expenditure in these finance data are prepared from management accounts spanning two financial years, which can be reconciled to the published accounts for 2005 and 2006.

 <br><br></li><li>

The Royal College of Music 2005/06 FSR submission to HESA has been completed on the new basis adopted for the College's 2005/06 consolidated accounts in that the figures now include the Prince Consort Foundation (PCF). The comparatives for 2004/05 are similarly amended to include the PCF.

<br><br></li><li>

  <li>Due to the particular nature of the structure of the UHI Millennium Institute, teaching and research activities are carried out by constituent partners and these staff have been returned as atypical. Non-academic staff at these partner organisations have not been returned. <br /><br /></li>

  <li>From 2005/06 the FSR submission to HESA from the Royal College of Music has been completed on the basis adopted for the College's 2005/06 consolidated accounts in that the figures include the Prince Consort Foundation (PCF). 

The 2006/07 FSR submission to HESA from the Royal College of Music has been completed on the new basis adopted for the College's 2006/07 consolidated accounts in that the figures now include the College's share of the results of the Associated Board of the Royal Schools of Music (ABRSM), in which it holds a 25% interest. <br /><br /></li>

  <li>The financial data supplied by the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) is extracted from the RCN audited accounts based on an April to March accounting year. This information is consistent with note 20 in the accounts which specifically refers to the results of RCN Institute. Income and expenditure relating to the RCN Institute is fairly consistent month on month, therefore inconsistencies with data relating to the August to July reporting period should be minimal. <br /><br /></li>

  <li>The University of Buckingham publishes audited accounts to 31 December each year. Consequently, the income and expenditure in these finance data are prepared from management accounts spanning two financial years, which can be reconciled to the published accounts for 2006 and 2007. <br /><br /></li>

  <li>A number of students at the University of Bedfordshire were re-assigned from cost centre 33 to 30 in the 2006/07 Student Record, but the consequential changes were not made in the 2006/07 Staff Record. <br /><br /></li>

  <li>The 2006/07 HESA Finance Return for Royal Northern College of Music is based on the institution’s draft consolidated financial statements. <br /><br /></li>

  <li>The 2006/07 HESA Finance Return for Cumbria Institute of the Arts is based on the institution’s draft consolidated financial statements. <br /><br /></li>

  <li>The 2006/07 HESA Finance Return for London Metropolitan University is based on the institution’s draft consolidated financial statements.<br /><br /></li>

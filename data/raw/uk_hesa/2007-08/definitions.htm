<h1>Definitions</h1>

<h1>Finance data </h1>

<h2>Reference dates </h2>

<p>Financial data relates to the institutions' financial year, i.e. 1 August 2007 to 31 July 2008. <br /><br /></p>


<h2>Coverage </h2>

<p>The annual Finance Statistics Return (FSR) is the main source of historical financial information on the total activities of all UK higher education institutions (HEIs). The FSR provides data in respect of the consolidated income and expenditure account, balance sheet and cash flow statement. The figures recorded for the consolidated income and expenditure account, the balance sheet headings and cash flow statement should be the same as those recorded in the HEIs audited/published financial statements. The financial statements should be prepared in accordance with the Statement of Recommended Practice: Accounting for Further and Higher Education Institutions (SORP), and comply with the financial reporting requirements contained in any UK legislation relevant to their constitution, such as the Companies Act and the Charities Act. 
</p>
<p>The categories used in the FSR for the HEI income and expenditure figures are defined below. <br /><br /></p>


<h2>Sources of income </h2>

<h3>Funding body grants </h3>

<p><b>Funding body grants</b> include those from the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE), the Higher Education Funding Council for Wales (HEFCW), the Scottish Further and Higher Education Funding Council (SFC), the Training and Development Agency for Schools (TDA) and the Department for Employment and Learning Northern Ireland (DEL(NI)). </p>

<p><b>Grants for higher education (HE) provision</b> includes recurrent grants and capital grants as defined below in respect of higher education (HE) provision, except in Scotland where this category also includes grants for further education (FE) provision. </p>

<p><b>Recurrent grants</b> includes the block grant (or main and associated grants) for teaching <b>Recurrent (teaching)</b>, research <b>Recurrent (research)</b> and other recurrent grants <b>Recurrent - other (including special funding)</b> as shown in the annual grant letter or additional grant letter from the funding councils. </p>

<p><b>Release of deferred capital grants</b> comprises the release of deferred capital grants for <b>buildings</b>, which includes where capital funding has been applied to the purchase of an asset that has been capitalised and <b>equipment</b>, which includes the purchase of furniture or other assets that have been capitalised. </p>

<p><b>Grants for FE provision (not applicable to SFC)</b> includes all funding council grants for the provision of FE. Grants from HE funding councils and FE funding councils are added together. This category does not apply to SFC funded institutions, as they do not receive separately identified grants for non-advanced/FE provision. </p>

<h3>Tuition fees &amp; education contracts </h3>

<p>This includes all income received in respect of fees for students on all courses for which fees are charged. Where fees are waived in whole or in part, the income due though not received is included. </p>

<p>Following the introduction of variable student fees in the 2006/07 academic year for institutions in England, Northern Ireland and Wales, this information is now administration specific. </p>

<p><b>Full-time HE fees</b> (England and Northern Ireland only) includes all fees for full-time and sandwich undergraduate or postgraduate courses for home and European Union (EU) domiciled students. </p>

<p><b>Part-time HE fees</b> (England, Northern Ireland and Scotland) includes all fees for part-time undergraduate or postgraduate courses for home and EU domiciled students. </p>

<p><b>Full-time HE fees - standard rates</b> (Scotland only) includes standard fees for full-time and sandwich undergraduate or postgraduate courses for home and EU domiciled students. </p>

<p><b>Full-time HE fees - non-standard rates</b> (Scotland only) includes all other fees for full-time and sandwich undergraduate or postgraduate courses for home and EU domiciled students. </p>

<p><b>Full-time HE fees - new</b> (Wales only) includes fees for all full-time and sandwich undergraduate or postgraduate courses with a start date on, or after, the beginning of the current reporting period. </p>

<p><b>Full-time HE fees - continuing</b> (Wales only) includes fees for all full-time and sandwich undergraduate or postgraduate courses with a start date prior to the current reporting period. </p>

<p><b>Part-time HE fees</b> (Wales only) includes fees for all part-time degree undergraduate or postgraduate courses. </p>

<p>Welsh <b>Full-time HE fees - new</b>, <b>Full-time HE fees - continuing</b> and <b>Part-time HE fees</b> are further divided between courses for <b>home domiciled students</b> and <b>EU domiciled students</b>. </p>

<p><b>Non-EU domicile students</b> includes fees for all HE courses for non-home and non-EU domiciled students. </p>

<p>The definitions of domicile, mode, and level of study should be those consistent with the HESA Student Record and are summarised below: <br /><br /></p>


<h2>Domicile</h2>

<p><b>Home domicile</b> students are those whose normal residence is in the UK, and for the purpose of analyses includes Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man. (Officially, the Crown Dependencies of Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man are not part of the UK or the EU.) </p>

<p><b>EU domicile</b> students are those whose normal residence is those not already defined as UK, and which were European Union (EU) members as at 1 December of the reporting period. <br /><br /></p>


<h2>Mode </h2>

<p><b>Full-time and sandwich</b> students are those normally required to attend an institution for periods amounting to at least 24 weeks within the year of study, on thick or thin sandwich courses, and those on a study-related year out of their institution. During that time students are normally expected to undertake periods of study, tuition or work experience which amount to an average of at least 21 hours per week. </p>

<p><b>Part-time</b> students are those recorded as studying part-time, or studying full-time on courses lasting less than 24 weeks, on block release, or studying during the evenings only. <br /><br /></p>


<h2>Level of study </h2>

<p>HESA classifies courses according to a framework which aligns with the framework for HE qualifications in England, Wales and Northern Ireland (FHEQ), the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework (SCQF) (of which the framework for qualifications of HE institutions in Scotland is a constituent part) and the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED) and Bologna frameworks. Details are available at <a href="http://www.hesa.ac.uk/C07051/a/COURSEAIM">www.hesa.ac.uk/C07051/a/COURSEAIM</a>. It includes level M for taught masters degrees, and level H for honours degrees. </p>

 
<p><b>Undergraduate</b> courses are programmes of study at level H, I, J and C including, but not limited to, first degrees (including eligibility to register to practice with a health or social care or veterinary statutory regulatory body), first degrees with qualified teacher status (QTS)/registration with the General Teaching Council (GTC), Postgraduate bachelors degrees at level H, enhanced first degrees, first degrees obtained concurrently with a diploma and intercalated first degrees, Professional Graduate Certificate in Education (PGCE at level H), foundation degrees, diplomas in HE with eligibility to register to practice with a health or social care regulatory body, Higher National Diploma (HND), Higher National Certificate (HNC), Diploma of Higher Education (DipHE), Certificate of Higher Education (CertHE), foundation courses at HE level, National qualifications framework levels 4 and 5, post-degree diplomas and certificates at undergraduate level, professional qualifications at undergraduate level and other undergraduate diplomas and certificates including post-registration health and social care courses. Entrants to these programmes of study do not usually require an HE qualification. </p>

<p><b>Postgraduate</b> courses are those leading to higher degrees, diplomas and certificates (including Postgraduate Certificate in Education (PGCE at level M) and professional qualifications) which usually require a first degree as an entry qualification (i.e. already qualified at level H). </p>

<p><b>Non-credit-bearing course fees</b> includes all fee income received in respect of non-credit-bearing liberal adult education, continuing education or extra-mural courses. </p>

<p><b>FE course fees</b> includes fee income received for the provision of FE/non-advanced courses. </p>

<p><b>Research training support grants</b> includes all grants made by Research Councils and other bodies in support of the training of research students. This includes bench fees and Collaborative Awards in Science and Engineering (CASE) awards. It also includes income from Doctoral Training Grants and Collaborative Training Accounts (or similar postgraduate grants) including the tuition fee element but excludes any element that is passed on by the institution as a student stipend or bursary. </p>

<p><b>Source of fees</b> are grouped into three categories comprising: The Student Loans Company (SLC), Local Education Authority (LEA), Student Awards Agency for Scotland (SAAS) or the Department for Employment and Learning Northern Ireland (DEL(NI)); Department of Health (DH) (including the National Health Service (NHS) Workforce Development Confederations and NHS Trusts), Regional Offices of the NHS Executive (RONE) or the Scottish Home and Health Department (SHHD); or other sources not covered above, including individual students. <br /><br /></p>

<h1>Staff data </h1>

<h2>Coverage </h2>

<p>The staff record provides data in respect of the characteristics of members of all academic and non-academic staff employed under a contract of employment by a higher education institution (HEI) in the UK. <b>Academic staff</b> are defined as academic professionals who are responsible for planning, directing and undertaking academic teaching and research within HE institutions. They also include vice-chancellors, medical practitioners, dentists, veterinarians and other health care professionals who undertake lecturing or research activities. <b>Non-academic staff</b> are defined as those that do not have an academic employment function such as managers, non-academic professionals, student welfare workers, secretaries, caretakers and cleaners. Staff employed under consultancy contracts, or on the basis of payment of fees for services, without a contract of employment, are not included in the record. </p>

<p>The record is collected in two sections; the Staff person table and the Staff contract table. The person table contains one record for every person employed by an institution during the HESA reporting period 2007/08 (1 August 2007 to 31 July 2008 inclusive) and contains attributes of the individual such as birth date, gender and ethnicity. Each person's employment with an institution will be governed by a legally-binding contract and each contract that exists is recorded on the contract table. If a person has a single contract with the institution there will be one record on the person table and one record on the contract table. If a person has three contracts with an institution there will be one record on the person table and three records on the contract table. </p>

<p>The range of data required about an individual and the contract(s) that they hold will depend on the nature of those contracts and also the classification of the activity for which the contract exists. For <b>atypical staff</b>, whose contracts are those with working arrangements that are not permanent, involve complex employment relationships and/or involve work away from the supervision of the normal work provider, only a minimum data set is required. For <b>staff (excluding atypical)</b> where one or more of the contracts held during the reporting period cannot be defined as atypical, and includes open-ended/permanent and fixed-term contracts, there is a requirement to return a wider range of data (which may include salary information and start and end dates of employment and contracts). </p>

<p>The <b>HESA staff person population</b> is an indicator of those individuals who have one or more contracts that are active on 1 December within the reporting period. Atypical staff are not counted in this population. </p>

<p>The HESA staff person population is used in analyses of staff person attributes by full-person equivalents (FPE). </p>

<p>The <b>HESA staff atypical population</b> is an indicator of those individuals who have only atypical contracts within the reporting period. </p>

<p>The HESA staff atypical population is used in analyses of atypical staff person attributes by full-person equivalents (FPE). </p>

<p>The <b>HESA staff contract population</b> is an indicator of those contracts that were active on 1 December within the reporting period. Atypical staff contracts are not counted in this population. Other staff with a default (or unknown) contract start date, a default (or unknown) contract end date and a contract full-time equivalent (FTE) of zero are also not counted in this population. </p>

<p>The HESA staff contract population is used in analyses of staff contract attributes by full-person equivalents (FPE). </p>

<p>The <b>HESA staff contract session population</b> is an indicator of those contracts that were active during the reporting period. Atypical staff contracts are counted in this population. </p>

<p>The HESA staff contract session population is only used in analyses of staff cost centre activity, or when summing full-time equivalents (FTE) from the contract table, during the reporting period. <br /><br /></p>


 
<h2>Rounding strategy </h2>

<p>Due to the provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Human Rights Act 1998, HESA implements a strategy in published and released tabulations designed to prevent the disclosure of personal information about any individual. These tabulations are derived from the HESA non-statutory populations<a name="footnote1"></a><a href="#footnotes"><sup>1</sup></a> and may differ slightly from those published by related statutory bodies. This strategy involves rounding all numbers to the nearest multiple of 5. A summary of this strategy is as follows: </p>

<ul>
<li>0, 1, 2 are rounded to 0 </li>
<li>All other numbers are rounded to the nearest multiple of 5 </li>
</ul>
<p>
So for example 3 is represented as 5, 22 is represented as 20, 3286 is represented as 3285 while 0, 20, 55, 3510 remain unchanged. </p>

<p>This rounding strategy is also applied to total figures, the consequence of which is that the sum of numbers in each row or column rarely matches the total shown precisely. Note that staff data calculated by full person equivalents (FPE) will also be rounded in accordance with this strategy. </p>

<p>Average values, proportions and FTE values prepared by HESA are not usually affected by the above strategy, and are calculated on precise raw numbers. However, percentages calculated on populations which contain 52 or fewer individuals will be suppressed and represented as '..' as will averages based on populations of 7 or fewer. </p>

<p>Data on financial affairs of higher education institutions does not fall within the definition of 'personal data' under the Data Protection Act 1998, and is therefore exempt from the above provisions. <br /><br /></p>


<h2>Full-time equivalent </h2>

<p>Staff <b>full-time equivalent (FTE)</b> indicates the percentage of a full-time equivalent year being undertaken over the course of the reporting period 1 August to 31 July. The FTE is therefore counted using a population of staff who were active during the reporting period, not just on a given snapshot date (using the HESA staff contract session population). <br /><br /></p>


<h2>Full-person equivalent </h2>

<p>Individuals can hold more than one contract with an institution and each contract may involve more than one activity. In analyses staff counts have been divided amongst the activities in proportion to the declared FTE for each activity. This results in counts of full person equivalents (FPE). Staff FPE counts are calculated on the basis of contract activities that were active on 1 December of the reporting period (using the HESA staff contract population). <br /><br /></p>


<h2>Atypical full-person equivalent </h2>

<p>Individuals can hold atypical contracts with an institution and each contract may involve more than one activity. In analyses staff counts have been divided amongst the activities in proportion to the declared FTE for each activity. This results in counts of full person equivalents (FPE). Atypical staff FPE counts are calculated on the basis of those individuals who have only atypical contracts that were active during the reporting period (using the HESA atypical staff population). <br /><br /></p>


 
<h2>Mode of employment </h2>

<p><b>Full-time</b> staff are those whose contracts state that their mode of employment is full-time. This includes staff who work full-time for part of a year and term-time only staff who work full-time during the term. </p>

<p><b>Part-time</b> staff are those staff that work anything less than full-time. This includes atypical (unless shown separately) where institutions were unable to assign staff contracts to either the full-time or the part-time category. </p>

<p>Mode of employment is an attribute of the contract, not the person. Therefore, a person will be counted as wholly part-time, even if they hold a number of part-time contracts that sum to one FTE. The FPE allocated to the full-time category will only reflect the people that hold a full-time contract. This is consistent with the treatment of other attributes of the contract. <br /><br /></p>


<h2>Terms of employment </h2>

<p>Terms of employment describes the type of contract(s) a member of staff has with the institution at the date the data is returned to HESA, or date of leaving if earlier. </p>

<p><b>Permanent</b> staff are those who are employed on a contract of employment that states the member of staff as permanent or on an open-ended contract. This includes term-time only staff who are employed on an open-ended contract. </p>

<p><b>Fixed-term contract</b> staff are those employed for a fixed period of time or have an end date on their contract of employment. This includes staff on rolling fixed-term contracts. </p>

<p><b>Atypical</b> staff are those whose working arrangements are not permanent, involve complex employment relationships and/or involve work away from the supervision of the normal work provider. These may be characterised by a high degree of flexibility for both the work provider and the working person, and may involve a triangular relationship that includes an agent. Source: DTI Discussion Document on Employment Status, July 2003, paragraph 23. </p>

<p>In addition to this definition from the DTI, some HE specific guidance has been devised by HESA in consultation with institutions. Atypical contracts meet one or more of the following conditions: </p>
<ul>
<li>
are for less than four consecutive weeks - meaning that no statement of terms and conditions needs to be issued <br /><br /></li>

<li>are for one-off/short-term tasks - for example answering phones during clearing, staging an exhibition, organising a conference. There is no mutual obligation between the work provider and working person beyond the given period of work or project. In some cases individuals will be paid a fixed fee for the piece of work unrelated to hours/time spent <br /><br /></li>

<li>involve work away from the supervision of the normal work provider - but not as part of teaching company schemes or for teaching and research supervision associated with the provision of distance learning education <br /><br /></li>

<li>involve a high degree of flexibility often in a contract to work as-and-when required - for example conference catering, student ambassadors, student demonstrators. </li>
</ul><br />

<h2>Source of basic salary </h2>

<p>Source of basic salary indicates whether contract salaries are paid wholly or in part from funds other than general institution funds. Whether income can be regarded as general institution funds or not depends on the distinction between unrestricted and restricted income as defined in the 'Statement of Recommended Practice: Accounting in Higher Education Institutions' (SORP). Restricted income is that which can only be applied to a specific purpose or activity so designated by the grantor or donor. </p>

<p><b>Wholly institutionally financed</b> staff contracts are those paid wholly from general institution funds. </p>

<p><b>Principally financed by the institution</b> staff contracts are paid mainly from general institution funds and partly from another source. Principally financed by the institution is defined as that where the proportion financed by the institution equals, or is greater than, 50% of the basic salary. </p>

<p><b>Other sources of finance</b> - these staff contracts are paid mainly or wholly from sources other than general institution funds. Other sources of finance describes those contract salaries where the proportion financed by other sources is greater than 50%. These sources include NHS/General Medical or General Dental practice or Department of Health, DIUS Research Councils, UK based charities, UK central government bodies and local authorities, UK industry, commerce &amp; public corporations, European Union (EU) sources, other overseas sources and other sources not listed. </p>

<p>Where <b>All other sources of finance</b> appears in conjunction with <b>Wholly institutionally financed</b> it should be taken that <b>All other sources of finance</b> includes <b>Principally financed by the institution</b> plus <b>Other sources of finance</b>. </p>

<p>Where <b>Not applicable/not required</b> appears this is because atypical staff may be returned without a Source of basic salary. <br /><br /></p>


<h2>Academic employment function </h2>

<p>The academic employment function of a member of staff relates to the academic contract of employment and not the actual work undertaken. </p>

<p><b>Teaching only</b> staff are those whose contracts of employment state that they are employed only to undertake teaching. </p>

<p><b>Teaching &amp; research</b> staff are those whose contracts of employment state that they are employed to undertake both teaching and research. </p>

<p><b>Research only</b> staff are those whose contracts of employment state that the primary academic employment function is research only, even though the contract may include a limited number of hours teaching. </p>

<p><b>Neither teaching nor research</b> staff are those whose contracted academic employment function is neither teaching nor research, e.g. Vice-Chancellor. </p>

<p>Where <b>Not applicable/not required</b> appears this is because atypical staff may be returned without an Academic employment function. <br /><br /></p>


<h2>Grade (academic staff only) </h2>

<p>The grade structure indicates a staff member's grade for a particular contract of employment. Groups of grades have been devised with regard to the different grading scales used within different institutions. Grades have not, however, been linked to salary information. </p>

<p><b>Professors</b> includes heads of departments, professors, researchers (former UAP scale grade IV), clinical professors, and those appointed professors on a locally determined scale. </p>

<p><b>Senior lecturers &amp; researchers</b> includes principal lecturers, senior lecturers (former UAP/CSCFC scales), researchers (former UAP scale grade III), clinical senior lecturers and those appointed senior or principal lecturers on a locally determined scale. </p>

<p><b>Lecturers</b> includes lecturers, senior lecturers (former PCEF scale), clinical lecturers and those appointed lecturers on a locally determined scale. </p>

<p><b>Researchers</b> includes all research grades (former PCEF/CSCFC/UAP scale) not listed above and those researchers appointed on a locally determined scale. </p>

<p><b>Other grades</b> includes other grades of academic staff not listed above. </p>

<p>Where <b>Not applicable/not required</b> appears this is because atypical staff may be returned without a grade. </p>

<p>Analysis by staff grade is only meaningful where institutions have reported their staff within nationally recognised grade structures or within internal grade structures which facilitate differentiation on a similar basis. </p>

<p>Several institutions, including some large post-1992 universities, report their academic staff on a single grade structure, which does not have an independent category for the professor grade. Hence staff on the professor grade at institutions using the single grade scale cannot be distinguished from the senior lecturer grade, leading to the number of professors being under-counted for these institutions and for the sector as a whole. This under-counting will have a consequential effect on the proportions of professors within particular subject areas, cost centres and by gender. </p>

<p>No attempt has been made to collect grade information for non-academic staff as the wide range of grade structures used up to now in institutions could not straightforwardly or meaningfully be mapped to a set of national grades. </p>

<p>It is recognised that there have been significant changes and developments in higher education employment conditions in recent years. Central to this is the Framework Agreement on Pay Modernisation in Higher Education that was agreed in 2004. The Agreement provides a framework to modernise pay arrangements with the specific aim of promoting equality, transparency and harmonisation to ensure equal pay is delivered for work of equal value. Institutions negotiated grade structures for all staff locally against a nationally agreed pay spine. An increasing number of institutions have therefore moved away from nationally recognised grade structures. Since implementation of the Framework Agreement was completed by the sector in August 2006, the existing coding frame in the HESA Staff Record has become outmoded. </p>

<p>A decision has now been made that HESA will collect an additional Grade table as part of the Staff Record which will capture the detail of each institution's grade structure. The grade field in the Contract table will then be replaced with one that provides a link from the Contract table to the new Grade table. This will be implemented for 2008/09. </p>

<p>The Agency therefore advises caution in analysis of staff by grade.<br /><br /> </p>


<h2>Cost centre groups </h2>

<p>In certain analyses cost centres have been assigned into cost centre groups, which reflect both academic similarities and comparable resource requirements. </p>

<h2>Age </h2>

<p>Age is as at 31 August in the reporting period.<br /><br /></p>


<h2>Movement of academic staff </h2>

<p><b>Starters</b> are academic members of staff who commenced their contract of employment on or after 1st December in the previous reporting period and before or on 1st December in the current reporting period. This category does not include atypical staff. </p>

<p><b>Inflow</b> - where a <b>starter</b> whose contract of employment in the previous reporting period is not the current institution or another UK higher education institution, they are deemed to be new to higher education service. </p>

<p><b>Leavers</b> are academic members of staff for whom all contracts ended on or after 1st December in the previous reporting period and before or on 1st December in the current reporting period. </p>

<p><b>Outflow</b> - where a <b>leaver</b> whose destination on leaving is not the current institution or another UK higher education institution, they are deemed to have left higher education service. <br /><br /></p>


 
<h2>Ethnicity</h2> 

<p>It is HESA's intention to adopt national classifications where they exist and are appropriate. However, in the case of the Census 2001 ethnicity coding, there is no coding structure applicable throughout the UK, as variations exist in Scotland and Northern Ireland. To accommodate requirements for institutions to report locally to their devolved administrations, the coding frame has been revised. </p>

<p>Staff may choose not to reveal their ethnicity and therefore HESA advises that the figures reported in analyses are derived from a subset which may not be representative of the total staff population. </p>

<p>The ethnic category groupings from 2007/08: </p>
<p>
<b>White</b> includes: <br />
White - British <br />
White - Irish <br />
White - Scottish <br />
Irish Traveller <br />
Other White background.</p> 
<p>
<b>Other (including mixed)</b> includes: <br />
Mixed - White and Black Caribbean <br />
Mixed - White and Black African <br />
Mixed - White and Asian <br />
Other mixed background <br />
Other ethnic background. <br /><br /></p>


<h2>Disability </h2>

<p>Disability indicates whether a member of staff is disabled on the basis of their own self-assessment. Staff are not obliged to report a disability, and therefore HESA advises that the figures reported in analyses are derived from a subset which may not be representative of the total staff population. <br /><br /></p>


<h2>Nationality </h2>

<p><b>Nationality</b> defines the country of legal nationality. This is not necessarily the domicile. </p>

<p><b>UK nationality</b> staff are those whose country of legal nationality is the UK, and for analysis also includes Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man. (Officially, the Crown Dependencies of Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man are not part of the UK or the EU.) </p>

<p><b>Non-UK nationality</b> staff are those whose country of legal nationality is a country other than that defined as UK nationality. <br /><br /></p>


<h2>Location of institution </h2>

<p>The allocation of an institution to a geographical region is done by reference to the administrative centre of that institution. There may be staff employed in regions other than that of the administrative centre of the institution. </p>

<p>Although the Open University teaches throughout the UK, its administrative centre is located in South East England, and except where shown separately, is counted as a wholly English institution. <br /><br /></p>


 
<h2>SOC - Occupational coding for higher education staff </h2>

<p>The Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) provides a national standard for categorising occupational information. SOC forms the basis of occupational classification in a variety of national surveys that collect statistical information such as the Labour Force Survey and New Earnings Survey. The utilisation of SOC for classifying occupations within the HE sector therefore both allows for the heterogeneity of occupations that exist and enables comparisons to be made with other sectors of the economy and from a variety of data sources. </p>

<p>However, some difficulties emerge in the direct application of SOC for occupational coding within the HE sector. At the most aggregate level, SOC distinguishes nine broad categories termed Major Groups. The titles associated with these Major Groups, which by necessity have to be general in their nature to encompass all occupations, do not provide an intuitive method of classifying the occupations within HE. Additionally, the coding manuals of the Standard Occupational Classification contain information on many occupations and job titles that are not relevant to the HE sector. </p>

<p>The classification of occupations within higher education has therefore necessitated the development of a variant of the national standard that is relevant for the HE sector. This enables the classification of job titles found within the HE sector to fall into one of 13 broad occupational categories: </p>

<p><b>Activity</b></p>
<p>

1	  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Managers <br />
2A	&nbsp;&nbsp; Academic professionals <br />
2B	&nbsp;&nbsp; Non-academic professionals <br />
3A	&nbsp;&nbsp; Laboratory, engineering, building, IT &amp; medical technicians <br />
3B	&nbsp; Student welfare workers, careers advisers, vocational training instructors, personnel &amp; planning officers <br />
3C	&nbsp; Artistic, media, public relations, marketing &amp; sports instruction occupations <br />
4A	&nbsp;&nbsp; Library assistants, clerks &amp; general administrative assistants <br />
4B	&nbsp; Secretaries, typists, receptionists &amp; telephonists <br />
5	  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chefs, gardeners, electrical &amp; construction trades, mechanical fitters &amp; printers <br />
6	  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Caretakers, residential wardens, sports &amp; leisure attendants, nursery nurses &amp; care occupations <br />
7	  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Retail &amp; customer service occupations <br />
8	  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drivers, maintenance supervisors &amp; plant operatives <br />
9   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Cleaners, catering assistants, security officers, porters &amp; maintenance workers. </p>

<p><b>Academic</b> staff are defined as academic professionals who are responsible for planning, directing and undertaking academic teaching and research within HE institutions. They also include vice-chancellors, medical practitioners, dentists, veterinarians and other health care professionals who undertake lecturing or research activities. All academic staff fall into group 2A of the SOC classification, regardless of their discipline (e.g. science, engineering, social sciences, humanities, languages). </p>

<p><b>Non-academic</b> staff are defined as members of staff who fall into one of the remaining 12 occupational categories such as managers, non-academic professionals, student welfare workers, secretaries, caretakers and cleaners. </p>

<li>For 2007/08 there was no 2006/07 restated data requirement for the two new Balance sheet Endowments sub-heads Endowments: Expendable and Endowments: Permanent. Total endowments continued to require a restated figure.  <br /><br /></li>

<li>Dartington College of Arts merged with University College Falmouth. However, both institutions continued to make separate returns for the HESA 2007/08 reporting period.  <br /><br /></li>

<li>Due to the particular nature of the structure of the UHI Millennium Institute, teaching and research activities are carried out by constituent partners and these staff have been returned as atypical. Non-academic staff at these partner organisations have not been returned.   <br /><br /></li>

<li>From 2005/06 the FSR submission to HESA from the Royal College of Music was completed on the basis adopted for the College's consolidated accounts in that the figures included the Prince Consort Foundation (PCF). As the PCF was wound up in 2007 and its assets transferred to the College, it is not included in the 2007/08 accounts. The 2006/07 comparatives also reflect the College's figures only.   <br /><br /></li>

<li>The University of Buckingham publishes audited accounts to 31 December each year. Consequently, the income and expenditure in these finance data are prepared from management accounts spanning two financial years, which can be reconciled to the published accounts for 2007 and 2008.   <br /><br /></li>

<li>The 2007/08 HESA Finance Return for London Metropolitan University is based on the institution’s draft consolidated financial statements.   <br /><br /></li>

<li>The 2007/08 HESA Finance Return for Leeds College of Music is based on the institution’s draft consolidated financial statements.   <br /><br /></li>

<li>The FSR submissions for The University of East Anglia and The University of Essex include figures for income, net return and net assets for the University Campus Suffolk, which is a 50:50 joint venture between these two universities. <br /><br /></li>

<li>From 2007/08 tables 25, 26a, 26b and 26c include all staff. Previously, atypical staff were excluded from these tables. <br /><br /></li>

<li>Academic grade is not applicable for atypical staff. <br /><br /></li>

<li>Staff whose ethnicity is not known includes those who have been coded 'information refused'.<br /><br /></li>

<li>Total academic staff includes staff whose nationality has been coded 'not known'. <br /><br /></li>

<li>Staff whose gender is 'not known' have been included in totals but are not shown separately. Staff whose gender is 'not known' includes staff whose gender has been coded 'unknown' plus those coded 'indeterminate'. <br /><br /></li>

<li>Due to the particular nature of the structure of the UHI Millennium Institute, teaching and research activities are carried out by constituent partners and these staff have been returned as atypical. Non-academic staff at these partner organisations have not been returned. <br /><br /></li>

<li>In 2008/09 The University of Plymouth misreported 2,435 staff with 'No known disability' as 'Other type of disability'. <br /><br /></li>

<li>In 2008/09 The University of Portsmouth misreported the HEI's total atypical staff contract FTE as 175.8. This should have been reported as 7.0 FTE. <br /><br /></li>

<li>In 2008/09 The University of Portsmouth misreported the HEI's total non-atypical, non-academic staff contract FTE as 1,528.5. This should have been reported as 1,359.4 FTE. <br /><br /></li>

<li>In 2008/09 The University of Manchester misreported the HEI's total academic services (cost centre 51) atypical staff contract FTE as 1,466.4. This should have been reported as 244.0 FTE. The HEI's central administration and services (cost centre 54) atypical staff contract FTE was misreported as 947.1. This should have been reported as 133.0 FTE. Additionally, residencies and catering (cost centre 57) atypical staff contract FTE was misreported as 720.9 FTE. This should have been reported as 143.4 FTE. <br /><br /></li>

<li>The 2008/09 HESA FSR submission is based on the following institutions' draft consolidated financial statements: University of Cumbria, Edinburgh College of Art, University of Glamorgan, University of Gloucestershire, London Metropolitan University, The University of Wales (central functions). <br /><br /></li>

<li>The University of Buckingham publishes audited accounts to 31 December each year. Consequently, the income and expenditure in these finance data are prepared from management accounts spanning two financial years, which can be reconciled to the published accounts for 2008 and 2009. <br /><br /></li>

<li>The FSR submissions for The University of East Anglia and The University of Essex include figures for income, net return, net assets and deferred capital grants for the University Campus Suffolk, which is a 50:50 joint venture between these two universities. <br /><br /></li>

<li>The 2008/09 HESA FSR submission for the University of Chester is based on a one-off 16 month financial statement ending 31 July 2009 (restated figures 12 months to 31 March 2008). This is to allow convergence to the 1 August to 31 July reporting period. <br /><br /></li>

<li>The 2009 and re-stated 2008 endowments expendable and endowments permanent were transposed in error within Cardiff University's 2008/09 HESA Finance Statistics Return. The correct figures for Cardiff University are as follows: 2009: endowments expendable: £4,133,000; endowments permanent: £17,959,000; 2008: endowments expendable: £4,487,000; endowments permanent: £19,850,000. There is no change to the total endowments figure. <br /><br /></li>

<li>In 2008/09 Loughborough University completed both the FSR Table 6a sections 'institutions in England and Northern Ireland only' and head 1d 'EU domicile students' for 'institutions in Wales only' in error. Values from these sections have been suppressed from introduction Table F, and main Tables 1 and 1b, retaining only the HEI's 'home &amp; EU domicile, HE course fees' total figure of £33,602,000, which has been included into the 'total tuition fees &amp; education contracts' figure. <br /><br /></li>

<li>In 2008/09 the HE-BCI survey total Scotland figures exclude data from HEIs that submitted an optional nil return to HESA. These are: Edinburgh Napier University; Queen Margaret University, Edinburgh; The Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama; Scottish Agricultural College; The University of the West of Scotland. <br /><br /></li>

<li>The 2008/09 RDA programme values were reported in error within The University of St Andrews HE-BCI Survey Part B return for Table 3. The correct figures for The University of St Andrews are as follows: 2008/09 RDA programmes income: £309,000. 2007/08 RDA programmes income: £159,000. <br /><br /></li>

<li>Two institutions submitted HE-BCI data for the first time in 2008/09 - these are University Campus Suffolk and University of Buckingham. Coverage of the survey should be borne in mind when comparing data in this volume with data published for previous years by the Higher Education Funding Council for England.<br /><br /></li>

<li>Staffordshire University reported a significant number of graduate start-ups as formal spin offs in error and therefore their figures for HE-BCI Survey Part B, Table 4 have been excluded.</li>

Due to the particular nature of the structure of the University of the Highlands and Islands, the majority of teaching and research activities are carried out by constituent partners. These staff are not returned in the Staff record.

<br/><br/></li><li>

The University of Oxford has a significant increase (245 in 2010/11 to 
830 in 2011/12) in the number of academic staff who have been classified
 as a 'Professor'. This is not an actual increase, but a change in how 
professors have been identified at the University of Oxford. This change should bring them more in line with the rest of the sector. 

<br/><br/></li>

<li>Leeds College of Art joined the HE sector and Leeds College of Music left the HE sector, therefore it is not appropriate to calculate starters and leavers data for these institutions.</li>

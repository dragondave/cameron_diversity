Due to the particular nature of the structure of the University of the Highlands and Islands, the majority of teaching and research activities are carried out by constituent partners. These staff are not returned in the Staff record.

<br/><br/></li><li>

Prior to 2012/13, 'Professor' was a term associated with those returned in the HESA Staff record as holding a contract for a professorial role. From 2012/13, this term is reserved for those who align with the Universities and Colleges Employers Association (UCEA) contract level of 'Professor', and as such the data is not directly comparable across years. Staff on contracts with multiple roles may have been classified at a different level, for example UCEA level 4A.

<br/><br/></li><li>

Due to the merger between the University of Wales Trinity Saint David and Swansea Metropolitan University, 595 (264.7 FTE) staff have been omitted from the University of Wales Trinity Saint David staff submission for 2012/13 (all previously Swansea Metropolitan University staff). The breakdown of these staff is as follows: 370 Academic staff (120.2 FTE), 225 Non-academic staff (144.5 FTE).</li>
